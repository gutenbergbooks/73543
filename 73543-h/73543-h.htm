<p>As in <i>English Monastic Life</i>, the volume I have already
contributed to this series of “The Antiquary’s Books,”
I have, in this book, been advised by the Editor to
avoid multitudinous footnotes and references. I here give a
list of works, in print and manuscript, out of which I have
endeavoured to reconstruct the picture of <i>Parish Life in
Mediæval England</i>, which I have tried to sketch in the
following pages.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE PARISH</p>


<p>Any account of parish life in mediæval England must
include much more than might at first sight be supposed.
To imagine that the story of the parson and
his church could adequately represent the story of the parish,
even with all that the one had to do for his people and all
that in the other was contained and done, is somewhat like
thinking that the biographies of kings and nobles and the
chronicle of their battles and achievements would tell properly
the story of a people or a country. The fact is, that
in those far-off days the parish church was the centre of
popular life all the country over, and that the priest and other
parochial officials were the recognised managers of many
interests beyond those of a strictly ecclesiastical nature.
Religion and religious observances then formed an integral
part of the English people’s very existence in a way somewhat
difficult for us to grasp in these days, when the
undoubted tendency is to set God and the things of God
outside the pale of ordinary worldly affairs, and to keep them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
out as far as possible. It is unnecessary here, of course, to
determine which method is right and which is wrong; but
it is useful, to say the least, that the fact of this change of
attitude should be borne in mind in any examination into
the parish life of mediæval England. To fail to appreciate
the intimate connection between the Church and the people
throughout that period of our national life will cause the
observer to misread many of the facts, upon which a correct
judgment of that time must depend. A writer in the <i>National
Review</i> does not overstate the truth when he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the Middle Ages the conscious sharing in a world-wide
tradition bound the local to the universal life, and through art and
ritual the minds of the poor were familiarised with facts of the
Christian faith. By our own poor I fear these facts are very dimly
realised to-day.”</p>
</div>

<p class="ph4">THE PARISH</p>

<p>At the outset it will be well to determine the exact
meaning of the word “parish,” and to establish as far as is
possible the origin of the English parochial system. As an
institution, although occupying so important a position from
the early Middle Ages, the division of the country into
parishes does not appear to have come down from great
antiquity. The word “parish”—the English equivalent for
the Latin <i>parocia</i>—is derived from the Christian use of the
Greek word παροικία in the sense of a district or diocese
under the rule and jurisdiction of a bishop. In a recent
paper on “The Rise of the Parochial System,” printed in the
<i>Transactions of the Exeter Architectural and Archæological
Society</i>, the author, the Rev. Oswald Reichel, has treated this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
question fully and in a most satisfactory manner. What has
been so well done need not be done over again. I consequently
make no apology for here following very closely his
line of argument and presenting his conclusions.</p>

<p>In Rome, Carthage, and other large cities, “for the sake
of the people,” as Pope Innocent I. says in a letter written
in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 416, there were district clergy appointed to preside
at the services on the Sundays. Even then, however, in
order that they might not consider themselves “separated
from his communion,” he sent to them by his acolytes what
he calls the “fermentum,” made by himself, which has been
variously interpreted to mean the Holy Eucharist consecrated
by him as bishop, or bread he had blessed, as a
symbol of the communion of all the district churches with
the central one; but which is almost certainly the former.</p>

<p>These district clergy, however, were not parish priests as
we understand them. For (1) they belonged to the church
of the bishop, though from time to time detailed for duty in
the various churches, which existed according to need in each
region or division of the city. Over each of these regions a
deacon presided as the bishop’s delegate. (2) The direct
government of the church and the cure of souls belonged to
the bishop in all places within his jurisdiction, and services
were performed by him, assisted by the city clergy, on fixed
days in various churches in rotation. (3) Although it is
possible to trace separate revenues for separate churches as
early as the end of the fifth century, the offerings of the
churches of a district were not kept apart, but were administered
by the deacon of the region to which they all belonged
as contributions to a common fund.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, that the district clergy, thus
described, cannot be claimed as the origin of our parochial
system. The English parish priest was established to meet
the needs of the country rather than of the city; and, beginning
in the first instance to act as chaplains of landowners,
who required the services of religion for themselves or their
tenants, they gradually acquired the position of ecclesiastical
freeholders. Appointed by the patron, they received their
office and their spiritual faculties from the bishop of the see;
and, whilst subordinated to him according to law, were yet
irremoveable except by the strict process of canonical law
and for serious offences.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the early dependence of the
priest on the patron, by the fourth Council of Orleans, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 541, 
the bishop was directed to control and protect these clergy
and in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 813 the Council of Mainz forbade laymen to
deprive presbyters of churches which they served or to
appoint them without episcopal sanction. It was not, however,
till the twelfth century, according to Mr. Reichel, that
the country parson had acquired full recognition as the
permanent and official ruler of a portion of the Lord’s
vineyard presided over by the bishop of the diocese.</p>

<p>The sphere of work of the local clergy was the parish,
which was by no means the same as the town, hamlet, or
manor. According to an authority, in the thirteenth century
the distinction was fully recognised. “For in one town there
may be several parishes,” he says, “and in one parish several
manors, and several hamlets may belong to one manor.”
The parochial system, then, in the Middle Ages, had come
to occupy three separate <i>functions</i>. It had acquired, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
first place, the notion of a well-defined group of families
organised for the purposes of social order and the relief of
needy brethren. Secondly, the word “parish,” applied to
the same group, was regarded as a sub-unit of ecclesiastical
administration, directly under the parish priest, indirectly
under the bishop. Thirdly, it was the name of the foundation
property or estate.</p>

<p>From the earliest times in the Christian Church the duty
of all to assist according to their means in the support of
their poorer brethren was fully recognised. The peculiar
method, however, of enforcing this duty by the regular payment
of tithes was apparently insisted on in the West by the
second Council of Macon in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 585, and in the Council of
Rouen in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 650. In England, to speak only of it, by the
middle of the tenth century the religious duty of paying tithe
was enforceable at law, and this tax was commonly called
“God’s portion,” “God’s consecrated property,” “the Lord’s
Bread,” “the patrimony of Christ,” “the tribute of needy
souls.” This was undoubtedly the view taken in pre-Reformation
days of the duty of all to pay the tenth portion of their
goods for the use of the Church. What that use was has
frequently been entirely misrepresented and misunderstood.
In the words of the author of the tract on the <i>Rise of the
Parochial System in England</i>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“it must be always remembered that in the view of the Church,
tithes other than first fruits, and tithes of increase, were destined not
to provide a maintenance for the clergy, but for the relief and support
of the poor; and the rector, whether of a religious house or
parochial incumbent, was supposed to administer them for these
purposes, he being only a ruler or administrator of them....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
During the whole of the time that the English Church was ruled
as an integral part of the Western Patriarchate, this view of the
destination of tithes, and of the rector’s or administrator’s duty in
respect of them, was never lost sight of.”</p>
</div>

<p>In regard, then, to the general notion of a parish, and as
to how the parochial system was extended and developed in
England, Mr. Reichel’s general summary at the end of his
tract is important and interesting. It began, he concludes,
in Saxon times, and assumed its complete form in the
Councils of London and Westminster in the twelfth century.
In the centuries which followed, and with which we are concerned,
the administration of tithes was frequently entrusted
to the actual incumbent, and in some cases to religious
houses or collegiate establishments. But in any case the
duty of the administrator was understood and acknowledged,
and, it must be supposed, acted upon. The mistaken notion
as to this has arisen probably from a neglect to bear in mind
what happened at the period of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At and since the Reformation,” says our author, “custom has
persistently regarded such administrations as endowments of the
parson, clerical or lay, not as gifts to the poor, of which he is only
the administrator. Monastic parsons were then simply deprived of
them by law, and the administrations they held were granted as
property to laymen, whilst, to meet the wishes of a married clergy,
parochial incumbents were released from all claims at law for
charitable purposes.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is important to bear in mind that a properly organised
“parish” was a corporation, and acted as a “corporation,”
and as such no lords of the manor or political personages had
any sort of power or authority over it. They might be, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
in fact, of course always were, members of the corporation--parishioners—and
their positions entitled them to respect
and gave, no doubt, authority to their suggestions. But
the records of the old parishes that have come down to our
time clearly prove that “Squire-rule” over parson and people
in mediæval parochial life did not exist. Sometimes, no
doubt, the “great men” of a place tried to have their own
way, but they were quickly shown that the “corporation” of
the parish was under the protection of a power greater than
any they possessed—the power of the Church; and, as a
matter of fact, this was so well recognised that it is difficult
enough to find individual instances of any great landlords
who were willing to try conclusions with the paramount
Spiritual authority. To “Holy Mother Church” all were the
same, and within God’s House the tenant, the villain, and the
serf stood side by side with the overlord and master. In fact,
at times, as when a feast fell upon a day when work had to
be done by custom for the lord of the manor, the law of the
Church forbade these servile works, and the master had perforce
to acquiesce. In other words, the parish, so far as it
was organised, had been the creation of the Church, and
was free.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The parish,” writes Bishop Hobhouse, “was the community of
the township organised for Church purposes, and subject to Church
discipline, with a constitution which recognised the rights of the
whole body as an aggregate, and the right of every adult member,
<i>whether man or woman</i>, to a voice in self-government, but at the
same time kept the self-governing community under a system of
inspection and restraint by a central authority outside the parish
boundaries.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>One thing especially bound the parish together most
firmly. The fact that the belief and practice of all was
the same—that every soul in the parish worshipped in the
same church and in the same way, that all kept the same
fasts and feasts and were assisted by the same Sacraments,
gave a unity to the corporation almost impossible now to conceive.
But over and above this, the knowledge that parson
and people were bound together by the parochial system,
and, so to speak, existed for each other, strengthened even
the ties of pure religion. In nearly all the documents illustrating
parish life of, say, the fifteenth century, there is
evidence of the community of purpose of pastor and people
which is really astounding. As already pointed out, every
rector and vicar throughout England not only regarded
himself in theory as a steward of the <i>panis Dominicus</i> (the
Lord’s Bread), under which name was meant charity to
all that came to claim support; but if the laws of the
English Church and Lyndwood’s authoritative gloss mean
anything whatever, this sacred duty was carried out in
practice. Wherever rectors do not reside in the place of
their cures, says Archbishop Peckham, they are bound to
keep proctors or agents to exercise proper hospitality or
charity as far as the means of their churches will allow, and
at the very least to relieve every parishioner in extreme
necessity; and the gloss adds that the rector of a church
on the high-road and in a frequented place will obviously
have to spend much more than one whose cure lies off the
beaten track. For this reason, it says, the clergy of the
churches in England are well endowed, especially where
the calls upon them for this hospitality are great.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>This duty of considering the revenues of a parish as
common property to be held in trust for the needs of
hospitality and the relief of the poor is inculcated in every
tract dealing with the subject, and acknowledged in numberless
ways. In the will of William Sheffield, Dean of
York in 1496, for example, the testator, after making some
small bequests, says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I will that the rest of my goods be distributed amongst the
poor, in all the benefices that I have ever held or now hold—more
or less being given according to the length of time I have lived in
them and maintained hospitality—for the property of a church is
the property of the poor, and for this reason the conscience is
greatly burdened in the disposal of the goods of the Church. And
for the heavy responsibility of these distributions, Jesus have mercy.”</p>
</div>

<p>In another case, in the diocese of Exeter in 1440, a
rector is specially praised at a Visitation, and it is declared
that he “has done much good, in his parish, because he
has rebuilt the chancel of his church, and has added two
good rooms, one for himself, and ‘one to exercise hospitality’
in behalf of those who need it.”</p>

<p>Here, before speaking of the working of a parish in
pre-Reformation days, it may be convenient briefly to treat
about the somewhat intricate question of tithes. The gifts
offered by the faithful to the Church for the support of the
ministers, the upkeep of its officers, or as an acknowledgment
of special services, such as baptisms, marriages, the churching
of women, and burials, were roughly classed under two
main divisions—tithes and oblations. The latter were personal,
and to a large extent voluntary, although custom had
somewhat determined the minimum fees which all who could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
were expected to pay for services exercised in their behalf.
In England, as Lyndwood notes, oblations were almost
wholly made in the form of money; and by law these offerings
were regarded more as being the personal property
of the priests than were tithes, and for this reason they might
be spent more freely, according to the wishes of the clergy.
Still, even in regard to this, the insertion of the word
“generally” in the law seems to the author of the gloss
to point to the fact that the clergy are not altogether free
as to the application of any surplus from these oblations
made to them, if for no other reason than because any
apparent squandering of such ecclesiastical revenues might
“tend to destroy the devotion of the people.” In oblations
of this sort, of course, are not included such as were made
in kind for the service of the altar and offered to the
priest during the Mass, such as the bread and wine for
the Sacrifice, brought in turns by the chief parishioners on
Sundays and Feast-days.</p>

<p><i>Tithes</i> are commonly defined as “the tenth part of all
fruits and profits justly acquired, owed to God in recognition
of His supreme dominion over man, and to be paid to
the ministers of the Church.” In the Old Dispensation this
recognition was made by Abraham, promised under vow by
Jacob, and legally regulated by Moses. In early Christian
times, if there is no evidence of the existence of the practice,
it is only because the voluntary offerings of the faithful
were ample to supply the needs of the Church and its
ministers, whilst the community of goods practised by the
first Christians hardly allowed the existence of real poverty
among them. As the Church grew, its needs, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
particular the less obvious needs of the faithful poor, required
some more regular and certain resources than the irregular
and voluntary alms of its richer members. So in the Council
of Macon in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 585 is found the first express declaration
of the Christian obligation of paying tithes, not indeed as
a new law, but as the assertion of an admitted Christian
principle. In the eighth century these payments began to
be regularly made throughout the Western Church, and in
England, according to the Saxon Chronicle, in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 855 the
father of King Alfred, Ethelwulf of Wessex, is said to have
“assigned to the Church the tenth part of his land all over
his kingdom for the love of God and his own everlasting
weal.” In this it is almost certain that the Chronicle is
wrong in the form of expression, and that what Ethelwulf
did was to decree the payment of a tithe of the produce,
and not hand over a tenth of the land as an endowment
of the Church. And here it may be well to remark that
there was obviously nothing sacro-sanct about the tenth
portion payable for Church purposes. It is merely a portion
that is taken to represent what is generally a fair offering
to God, and one not too burdensome on those who had to
pay. In some cases it might be and indeed, according to
custom, was greater or less in different places.</p>

<p>Tithes were usually divided into two kinds—<i>predial</i> and
<i>personal</i>; “some coming of the earth,” says the author of
<i>Dives and Pauper</i>, “as corn, wine, bestayle, that is brought
forth by the land, and such thyngs be clepyd <i>predyales</i> in
latyn. Some thyngs comyth oonly of the person, as be
merchandy and werkmanschyp, and such bene clepyd <i>personales</i>
in latyn.” In these a man is to account his expenses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
and then see whether he has gained, and so pay a tithe of
his profit; but this may not be done in the case of the predial
tithes. In these “he is not to count his expenses, but pay
his tithe of all, neither the worst nor the best, but as it
comes.”</p>

<p>The Council of Merton, in 1305, set forth a schedule of
the things upon which tithes had to be paid by law; this
included the cutting and felling of trees and woods, the
pasturage of the forests, and the sale of the timber; the
profits of vineyards, fisheries, rivers, dovecots, and fish-stews;
the fruits of trees, the offspring of animals, the grass harvest,
and that of all things sown; of fruits, of warrens of wild
animals, of hawking, of gardens and manses, of wool, flax,
and wine; of grain and of turf, where it was dug and dried; of
pea-fowl, swans, and capons; of geese and ducks; of lambs,
calves, and colts, of hedge cuttings, of eggs, of rabbits, of
bees with their honey and wax; together with the profits
from mills, hunting, handicrafts of all sorts, and every manner
of business. As to these, <i>Dives and Pauper</i>, on the authority
of canonists, teaches that people should be reminded that
tithe is, in the first place, an acknowledgment to God for
what He has Himself first given to men. Consequently, all
should willingly pay this tribute to Him, and thus continue
to deserve His blessings: also, that they should remember
that nothing was exempt from this tribute—wind-mills and
water-mills, tanneries and fulling-mills, all mines of silver
and other metals, all quarries of stone, and all profits of the
merchant and the craftsman.</p>

<p><i>Predial</i> tithe, in a word, was payable on the annual crops
of corn, wine, oil, and fruits, etc., and on the natural increase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
of cattle, including milk and cheese. These predial tithes
were distinguished, again, into the <i>Greater</i> tithe—that is, on
corn, wine, and wool; and the <i>Lesser</i> tithe on vegetables and
fruits, etc. The tithes <i>personal</i> were to be paid on profits of
trade and business. All this was acknowledged as sanctioned
or ordered by “Divine law or custom.”</p>

<p>All tithes on the land-predial were to be paid to the
rector of the parish in which the land was situated or the
animals usually fed; all tithes on business occupation, to
the parish where the tithe-payer was bound by law to receive
the Sacraments. “Tithes personal,” says the author above
quoted, “as of merchandise and of crafte, man shall payen
to his parish church where he dwelleth and taketh his
Sacraments and heareth his service, but tithes predial shall
been payed to the church to which the manor and the land
belongeth, unless custom be in the contrary.” Difficulties
sometimes necessarily arose as to cases where flocks of sheep,
etc., were at different times in different parishes, but by
episcopal constitutions this was settled on the common-sense
principle of dividing the tithe receivable, according to the
proportion of the time spent in each parish. It was otherwise
in the case of cattle feeding on land in several parishes—“horn
with horn,” as the natives called such a practice; in
this case the tithe was to be paid to the parish in which the
permanent sheds of the cattle at the farmstead were situated.
With difficulties of this nature it is not necessary to deal,
and the foregoing examples are given merely to show how
universal the practice was and how carefully the obligation
was fulfilled.</p>

<p>Bishop Peter Quevil, in the Synod of Exeter, held in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
1287, lays down several principles which are to guide the
authorities in the levying of tithes. It will be remembered
that it is from these Constitutions that so much as to the
practical working of the Church of England in the thirteenth
century is known. From what he says as to tithes, it seems
that there was growing up a practice of seeking to deduct
the cost of production before counting the tithe. This might
seem not unreasonable, but the bishop condemns it, and says
that “expenses are by no means to be deducted first.” In
the same way he refused to recognise as right any claim
to set aside a tenth part of a field and to count as tithe of
the whole whatever was grown upon that portion. So,
too, in the west country a practice had grown up in certain
places for farmers to refuse to pay their dues until the parson
had given a harvest feast and a pair of gloves to the workmen.
This is forbidden as contrary to law. In the same
way, as the bishop says, “many and well-nigh unanswerable
questions” arose in the levying of the tithe; but from time
to time these were made the subject of synodal directions, as
may be seen in Wilkins’ great collection, and in practice
these difficulties would appear generally to have answered
themselves by the application of a little common sense,
assisted by a measure of good-will, which most certainly
existed in those days.</p>

<p>It is usually difficult to obtain information about the
amounts of the tithe derived from the various sources titheable.
Generally the accounts do not set out the items, and
give merely the totals. For the diocese of Rochester, however,
in 1536, the <i>Valor Ecclesiasticus</i> gives the details in
many instances. From these we learn that the tithe generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
had a twofold division; for instance, the Rector of Huntingdon,
besides &#163;9 a year derived from the rectory house and
the rent of 21 acres of pasture, accounted for the tithe
of grain and hay, which produced, according to the then
money value, 26<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, and the tithe of wool and of
lambs, bringing in &#163;4 8<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> He received also an annual
average of &#163;17 2<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> from oblations and private donations.
In the same way the Vicar of Dartford received &#163;16 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
for the tithe of wool and lambs, &#163;2 for the hay tithe, and
&#163;25 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for all other tithes and oblations.</p>

<p>A word must now be said about the impropriation of
parochial tithes to cathedrals, monasteries, and collegiate
establishments. It is very generally stated that this was
one of the great abuses of the mediæval Church redressed
at the time of the Reformation. Without in any way wishing
to defend the practice of assigning tithes to purposes other
than the work of the parish in which they were receivable,
it should in justice be borne in mind that this was never
done without the sanction of the bishop, and upon the
condition that the vicar should receive amply sufficient for
his support and for the purpose of his parochial work.
The notion of “the great robbery” of parishes to endow
monasteries, and of the “miserable stipends” on which those
who occupied the post of vicars existed or starved, is in
view of records not borne out by facts. The “miserable
stipends” formed only part of the emoluments of those who
served impropriated churches; they had also the lesser tithes
and all oblations made to them, and the bishops were bound
by law to see, and in fact did see, that their income was
sufficient. Moreover, though not very numerous, there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
in the episcopal registers a sufficient number of examples
to show that the arrangements, made between the impropriators
and the vicar, and sanctioned by the bishop,
were open to readjustment if necessary. At East Anthony,
in the diocese of Exeter, for example, this is exemplified,
and the settlement made by Bishop Grandisson is confirmed
by Bishop Stapeldon, and the principle is laid down that
“the Bishop and his successors have power, should they
see fit, to encrease, diminish, or change the amount to be
paid to the holder of the vicarage and the conditions upon
which it is held.”</p>

<p>It will be useful to take one or two examples of the
division of tithes between the impropriator and vicar in an
impropriated living. The rectory of Preston, in the county
of Kent, for instance, was impropriated to St. Augustine’s,
Canterbury, which derived &#163;16 a year from it. Out of
this sum 53<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> in money was paid by way of pension
to the vicar, and 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in lieu of a certain quantity
of corn—in all &#163;3. This, however, was not by any means
the whole income enjoyed by the vicar, for he also received
from the lesser tithes and personal oblations another &#163;6 15<i>s.</i>,
bringing his stipend up to the sum of &#163;9 15<i>s.</i> a year, or
ample, according to the value of money in the sixteenth
century, to live upon. Again, the church of Monketon
and that of Birchington, in the same county of Kent, were
impropriated to the monastery of Christ Church, Canterbury.
From them the monks derived &#163;66 13<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> for their house,
and out of this &#163;1 12<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> had to be spent upon the poor
of the place, and &#163;12 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> was paid to the vicar as his
stipend. He received also &#163;11 annually from tithes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
oblations, and paid two curates, to serve Birchington and
another annexed chapel, &#163;9 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> This left him still
&#163;13 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> as his own annual stipend, which was about
three times what he considered sufficient for each of his
curates. To take one more example: from the church of
Chistlett the monks of St. Augustine’s, Canterbury—who,
by the way, were lords of the manor—received from the
rectorial tithes &#163;40 a year; the vicar’s tithes, together with
the glebe lands, bringing him &#163;30 a year.</p>

<p>It would appear from these instances, which could be
multiplied indefinitely, that, except for the fact that tithe
was taken from the district where it was raised, the grievance
of which so much has been made, is an academic rather
than a real one, and one of modern invention rather than one
existing in the Middle Ages. That there were complaints
occasionally may be allowed. Still, not only were they rare,
but in the episcopal registers it may be seen that, in the
few instances where they came before the bishop, they
were declared to be groundless. They generally arose out
of the Visitations when the vicar had been ordered to
repair the chancel of his church, or procure some choir-books,
or to do some other work for which by law the incumbent
was held responsible. The vicar pleaded as his excuse for
the dilapidation, or for his inability to do the work required,
that the impropriator should be made to do all this, as he
took so much of the tithe away from the place. It is rarely
indeed that such a claim was considered reasonable, and
for the most part the reply was that this had been considered
at the time of the original impropriation, and that sufficient
had been allowed to the vicar to carry out these legal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
obligations, and that all things had been made fitting and
all repairs seen to before the vicarage had been established.</p>

<p>The grounds upon which impropriation made by lawful
authority was justified in the Middle Ages were, apparently,
that originally tithe had been paid to the bishop of the
diocese for the general good of the entire district. By his
administration of these diocesan funds he was enabled to
assist good works of every kind at his discretion. When in
process of time the parish became a sub-unit of administration,
the local tithe passed into the administration of the
local parson; but never without the dormant notion, not
only of episcopal control, but fundamentally of ultimate
episcopal authority over it. Up to the Reformation it was
taught that tithe really ought to be divided into four parts:
one part to go to the bishop, if he needed it; one to the
ministers; one to the poor; and the fourth part for the
repair of the church fabric. The notion that it was the great
landowners who in the first instance endowed the parish
churches with tithes, and subsequently took them, or a
portion of them, away and gave them to religious houses
and colleges, is for the most part quite imaginary. Tithe
was, as already pointed out, the recognition of God’s supreme
authority over the world, and a public acknowledgment that
all things came from His hands, and the idea, which is a
product of modern notions, that it was a charge made upon
the land for the benefit of religion, is wholly alien to the
spirit of pre-Reformation days. The very fact that this does
not explain the existence of personal tithes, shows that the
giving of tithes generally did not depend upon the generosity
of any landowner or lord of the manor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Neither was the tithe ever regarded as the absolute
property of the incumbent. Besides his recognised duty
in regard to the repairs of the chancel, the poor were
regarded as having legal claims upon what was received by
him. What seems to us a somewhat strange custom was
occasionally practised in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
This was the farming out of tithes by the rectors, or,
in other words, raising money upon their expected receipts.
For this the sanction of the bishop had previously to be
obtained, and any pledging of the tithe for more than the
current year was illegal. Beyond this, where a rector or
prelate put his benefice out to farm, according to the law,
he was bound to get four of his parishioners, approved by the
bishop, to be surety for the faithful payment of the full
portion (<i>pinguis portio</i>) of the tithe due to the poor of the
parish. “I hold,” however, says the canonist Lyndwood,
that this is not necessary “in the case of a rector or prelate,
who, after farming out his tithes lawfully, continues to live in
his benefice, unless he is suspected of not intending to succour
those in poverty.”</p>

<p>The duty of paying lawful tithes was constantly inculcated
by synodal decrees, by bishops’ letters, and from the pulpit.
Thus John Myrc, in his <i>Instructions for Parish Priests</i>, tells
them—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Teche hem also welle and greythe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How they schell paye here teythe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all thynge that doth hem newe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They shuld teythe welle and trewe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">After the custome of that cuntraye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Every mon hys teythynge schale pay.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The author, however, says that he has no need to speak much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
of that matter, as priests will see to it that their tithes are
paid in due time; and in a <i>Sarum Manuale</i> it is found set
down that by law “men of religion, freres, and all other,” who
“go about and preache Goddes worde,” are commanded to
preach eight times in the year upon the nature of tithes and
on the obligation of paying them to the parish priests. That
this duty was recognised, and that on the whole it was cheerfully
complied with in the Middle Ages, would appear to be
certain. It is, moreover, no less apparent that these payments
were regarded, not in the light of a charge upon the
land, but of a genuine acknowledgment to God of His
supreme governance of the world, that all things were His,
and that in His hands were the ends of the earth. The general
spirit in which the obligation was regarded may be seen in
the wills of the period, where the testators not only desired
that all lawful tithes might be paid from their estates, but
very generally left benefactions to their parish churches “for
tithes forgotten.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE PARISH CHURCH</p>


<p>The “parish” is described by Bishop Hobhouse as the
community dwelling in an area defined by the Church,
organised for Church purposes, and subject to Church
authority. “Within this area,” he says, “every resident was
a parishioner, and, as such, owed his duty of worship and
contribution to one stated church, and his duty of confession
and submission to the official guidance of a stated pastor,
entitled his Rector, or to the Rectors deputy, entitled
Vicar.”</p>

<p>The centre of every mediæval parish, then, was its church.
It was, as it were, the mainspring of the machinery of
parochial life, which cannot be understood without a full
knowledge of its position in regard to the people generally,
and of all that it was to the inhabitants of a district in pre-Reformation
days.</p>

<p>For our present purposes, we need not, of course, concern
ourselves with trying to solve the vexed question as to who it
was that first built the parochial churches. About this there
is, and probably will remain, much obscurity. In the first
instance, in England, very possibly, they were the creation
of some nobles or rich landlords, who desired to secure the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
services of religion for the people dwelling upon their estates,
as tenants, servants, or serfs, and who, having obtained from
the bishop of the district his leave to set up an oratory or
church, obtained the ministration of a priest. Whatever the
origin, it is certain that long before the fourteenth or fifteenth
centuries the parish church had practically come to be the
property of the parishioners generally in a very definite
manner, and, with certain exceptions, to which reference will
presently be made, upon the inhabitants of a parochial district
as a corporation lay the duty of repairing and rebuilding the
fabric, of beautifying the edifice, of maintaining the services,
and of seeing generally to its well-being. This they did as a
matter of well-recognised obligation and duty; but obviously
also as a matter which afforded them much satisfaction and
pleasure.</p>

<p>The fabric of the church consisted of the <i>nave</i>, with its
chapels and aisles, when it had any, and the <i>chancel</i>, which
included the choir and presbytery. In England, at least,
there was a well-recognised and very general distinction between
the chancel and the nave. The former was sometimes
called the “parson’s freehold,” and to him belonged the entire
care of his “chancel,” and the duty of keeping it in repair.
In fact, it was not disputed that one part of the tithe received
by the priest from the parish was intended to furnish him
with ample means for fulfilling this duty, and in the event
of death removing an incumbent, where there were dilapidations
in the chancel, which had not been seen to by him,
his successor could, and frequently did, claim compensation
from the heirs of the deceased.</p>

<p>The synodal directions given with regard to the care and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
repair of the chancels are definite. “In parish churches,”
says one of 1350, taken as an example, “the chancel is to be
found and maintained fittingly in all things by the Rector.”
Bishop Brantyngham, of Exeter, issued a “declaration” as to
the custom in his diocese as laid down by his predecessor,
Bishop Quevil. In this he says that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“the work of constructing and repairing the chancels of all
mother churches belongs to the rectors of the parishes; but that
of the naves pertains to the parishioners, without regard to any
contrary custom. In the case of chapels, which have their distinct
parochial district, the entire duty of maintenance belongs to the
parishioners of the chapel, as it is for their convenience such chapels
are built, and, moreover, they may be obliged to assist, in case of
need, the mother church.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was the ordinary rule in England, as we see from
the gloss on the Constitutions of Cardinal Othoboni, where
Lyndwood calls it “the common custom in England that the
parishioners repair the nave of the church where they sit,”
and that if the rector has the fourth part of the tithe, which
was intended for the repairs of the church, he should by law
see to all the repairs. “By praiseworthy custom,” in England,
however, the author adds, the repair of the chancel only
is an obligation of the rector, although he cannot entirely
free himself of all responsibility for the rest of the church.
Sometimes, however, as the canonist notes, as, for example,
in some London churches and elsewhere, the care of the
chancel is also a matter for the parishioners, and the parson,
although taking “the fourth part of the tithe” intended to
meet the general expenses of church repairs, is yet held to be
free of the obligation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes, as may be seen in the visitations of parochial
churches, difficulties arose about the precise obligation of
parson and people as to the repair even of the chancel. In
the Register of Bishop Stapledon, for instance, at the inquiry
held in 1301, at St. Mary Church, the parishioners represented
that, up to the time of the then vicar, they had been accustomed
to repair the chancel, and because of this the tithe on
all store cattle had not been demanded of them. The new
vicar had made them pay this, but yet had not done the
repairs to the chancel, and wanted them to continue to do so.
So, too, during Bishop Grandisson’s episcopate, the question
whether the parishioners paid the “decimas instauri” was the
determining reason as to whether they should be compelled
to repair the chancels or not.</p>

<p>In regard to the care of the fabric the case of appropriated
churches was somewhat peculiar. The corporation to which
the living was impropriated held the position of rector, the
cure being administered by a vicar appointed by it and
licensed by the bishop, just as in the case of a nomination to
any benefice by a patron. As a rule the religious house,
college, or official holding the impropriated tithes, got rid of
the rectorial obligation of seeing to the maintenance of the
chancel, by arranging with the bishop that the vicar should
have sufficient regular income to cover all the expenses of
dilapidations. In this case the usual practice was that, upon
first becoming lawfully possessed of the appropriated tithe,
the corporation was bound by the bishop, as one condition of
his assent, to place the chancel in thorough repair and to see
that everything, which the rector had been bound by custom
to provide, was in good order. After this had been done,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
it was calculated, and indeed arranged, that out of the
income of the vicar these could be maintained in good order.
The arrangement, however, was subject to revision by the
bishop, and although in practice the original agreement was
usually upheld, there are to be found examples of the holders
of impropriated tithes being compelled by the ecclesiastical
authority to contribute to the repairs of chancels, etc., and
even to undertake the entire work, where the means of the
vicars were obviously inadequate to do what was necessary.</p>

<p>Some examples of this will illustrate the matter more
completely than any statement of the practice. In 1296,
Bishop Thomas de Bytton, of Exeter, was called upon to
adjudicate upon this question in regard to the vicarage of
Morwenstowe, the greater tithes of which had been previously
appropriated to the Hospital of St. John at Bridgewater by
Bishop Peter Quevil, with the consent of his canons. The
grant had been made with the provision that fitting support
should be allowed for the vicarage, the amount to be determined
and arranged by the bishop and his successors.
This, Bishop de Bytton did, in fact, determine by the document
referred to. The vicar, according to this settlement,
by reason of his vicarage, was to take certain tithes, which,
amongst others, were to include that of all the hay and the mills
in the whole parish, as well as the rent of certain crofts, etc.
The brethren of the Hospital were to find or renew all the
ornaments and books not provided by the parishioners, and
it was agreed that these, once being set right, must afterwards
be maintained by the vicar. He was also to see to all
ordinary repairs, and even extraordinary repairs up to the
amount of the fourth part of the tithe received by him. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
“any other extraordinary expense, together with the upkeep,
repair, or rebuilding of the chancel of the church, was to be met
by the said religious brethren” of the Hospital of Bridgewater.</p>

<p>That this settlement was not at all exceptional could be
proved by many documents; one must suffice. When Bodmin
church was rebuilt between the years 1469 and 1472 the
patrons, the Monastery of St. Petrock, defrayed the entire
expenses connected with the chancel. On the other hand, to
illustrate the usual practice, the case of the vicarage of
Launcells in Devonshire may be cited. The Abbot and Monastery
of Hartland held the appropriated tithes, and in 1382,
the chancel standing in need of great repairs, apparently
amounting almost to rebuilding, the vicar refused to carry
out the injunctions of the archdeacon forthwith to undertake
the work, on the plea that this was the duty of the Abbey
of Hartland. The convent denied their obligation, but submitted
themselves in the matter to the judgment of the
bishop of the diocese. After holding an inquiry, Bishop
Thomas Brantyngham declared that the vicar received tithes
for the purpose of carrying out all repairs to the chancel, and
that consequently the monks were free from the obligation.</p>

<p>What the material church was to the parishioners of a
mediæval parish is well described in the synodical Constitutions
of Bishop Woodlock, of Winchester, at the beginning
of the fourteenth century.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If the Israelites,” he says, “living in the shadow of the law,
required specially dedicated places in which to worship the Lord,
with how much more reason are Christians, to whom the loving-kindness
and the humanity of the Saviour has appeared, bound by all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the means at their disposal to obtain consecrated churches, in which
day by day the Son of God is offered in Sacrifice.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then after saying that churches that have not been consecrated
are to be solemnly dedicated as soon as possible, he
continues—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The anniversaries of the dedications of parish churches are to
be kept by the parishioners, and those attending chapels in the
neighbourhood not themselves dedicated. The day and the year of
the consecration, with the name of the consecrating prelates, are to be
entered in the calendar and other books belonging to the church.”</p>
</div>

<p>The dedication of the church to God was the essential
condition of its endowment. According to Bracton, the dower
made to the church with church lands at its dedication, was a
possession of “pure and free alms,” in distinction “from a lay
feud,” seeing that it “is with more propriety called free, since
it is dedicated as it were to God.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If,” says the Constitution of Cardinal Otho for the English
Church—“if under the Old Testament the Temple was dedicated to
God for the offering of dead animals, with how much more reason
should the churches of the New Law be specially consecrated to Him
when on the altars is daily offered for us by the hands of the priest
the living and true Victim, that is, Christ, the only-begotten Son of
God.”</p>
</div>

<p>The reverence due to churches, and things once dedicated
to the service of churches, was universal in the Middle Ages.
Cloths, used as chrism cloths at Baptism or Confirmation, were
to be devoted to ecclesiastical purposes or destroyed, and
those who turned anything thus once offered to God to any
secular use were considered gravely blameworthy. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
gloss upon a Constitution of St. Edmund of Canterbury to
this effect extends this prohibition of desecration to everything
connected at any time with a church. Even the woodwork
of a building, once dedicated, was to be destroyed,
unless it was capable of being used for another ecclesiastical
purpose. So too the “cloths used on the altar, the seats,
candlesticks, veils, and sacred vestments too old to use,”
were to be burnt and the ashes buried.</p>

<p>The parishioners, as already pointed out, were bound by
law and custom to provide for the repair of the nave of their
parish church, and for the general upkeep of the church
services. There was little need to compel them to fulfil this
duty, for the churchwardens’ accounts and other documents,
especially during the fifteenth century, when we have the
fullest information, show us that over the entire length and
breadth of England the people were gladly rebuilding and
beautifying their parish churches. A few examples of this
spirit may be of interest as showing what God’s house was to
the entire people in pre-Reformation days. The labours of
Prebendary Hingeston-Randolph on the diocesan registers of
the Exeter diocese enable the inquirer into parochial manners
and customs of the past to find ample material. In the
register of Bishop Stafford of Exeter (1394-1419) an account
of the rebuilding of the parish church of Broadhempston is
given. The parishioners, about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1400, petitioned the bishop
to be allowed to rebuild their church: they represented that
it was in a ruinous condition and notoriously clumsily constructed.
It was their wish, they said, to build it on a larger
scale, and in a different part of the churchyard. To this the
bishop assented, on condition of their promising to complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
the new church within two years of pulling down the old,
and he granted an Indulgence to all who should contribute to
“so great and pious a work.” On the 22nd November, 1401,
the work of the new church was apparently far enough
advanced for use, for a licence was granted for one year to
celebrate Divine service “in the church or basilica newly
erected and constructed in the cemetery,” and this licence was
twice renewed for the years 1402 and 1403.</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>Receipts and Expenses in Building Bodmin
Church</i>, published by the <i>Camden Society</i>, says that “there is
scarcely a parish in Cornwall that does not bear testimony to
the energy displayed in church restoration” in the last quarter
of the fifteenth century. He might have added that like
activity is manifested at this time in almost every quarter of
England; but certainly Bodmin furnishes us with an interesting
example of the religious energy displayed by the inhabitants
of a mediæval parish. For the year 1469-70 the
wardens account for &#163;196 7<i>s.</i> 4&#189;<i>d.</i> collected and &#163;194 3<i>s.</i> 6&#189;<i>d.</i>
spent—large sums considering the then value of money,
and specially great when it is remembered that besides
this there were the gifts of material, such as windows, trees,
etc., and that the labour of the workmen was given without
other reward than what came from their love of the work.
From the preface of the editor of these accounts we glean
some interesting particulars, all the more interesting as we
have no reason to think that Bodmin was any exception.
The accounts “exhibit a remarkable unanimity in the good
work. Every one seems to have given according to his means
and up to his means. Many who gave money gave labour
also; many who could not give money laboured as best they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
might, and others gave what they could.” We have gifts of
lambs, of a cow, and of a goose. One woman, in addition to
her subscription, sold her crock for 20<i>d.</i>; and all found its
way into the common treasury. No age or sex seems to have
kept aloof. We find an “hold woman” contributing 3<i>s.</i> 4&#189;<i>d.</i>,
while the maidens in Fore Street and Bore Street gave subscriptions
in addition to the sums received from the Guild of
Virgins in the same streets. The vicar gave his year’s salary,
and the “parish people” who lived out of the town “contributed
19<i>s.</i>” After an examination of the accounts, the editor
attributes the working up of the zeal of the people to the
guilds, and he adds that “religious life permeated society in
the Middle Ages, particularly in the fifteenth century, through
the minor confraternities.” Of these societies it will be necessary
to write at some length later, and here it will be sufficient
to say that almost every inhabitant of Bodmin appears to
have belonged to one or more of these societies. From the
long list of voluntary subscriptions, it appears that all were
eager to have a part in the work of building up their church—a
church which should be a credit to Bodmin. All sorts and
conditions of men and women are entered as contributors on
the roll of parishioners, more than 460 in number. Servants
appear as well as masters and mistresses, sons and daughters
as well as their fathers and mothers.</p>

<p>The same sort of story is told in every set of parish
accounts that we possess—a story of popular devotion to
the material fabric of the parish church. To take another
and later example: At St. Mary’s, Cambridge, 1515, it was
necessary to build a porch and a vestry, and the people
determined to make a voluntary collection for the work each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Sunday during the last six months of the year. At these,
from 6<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i>—from &#163;4 to &#163;5 of our money—was gathered
each time, and the building was carried out under the
supervision of the churchwardens.</p>

<p>The evidence of mediæval wills is the same as to this very
general interest in church building. For example, Robert
Dacres of Beverley, a weaver, who died in 1498, left &#163;16
for the making of the north aisle of the church—the parish
church in which he had worshipped—provided the wardens
began the work within a year. If they did not do so, then
the money was to be spent on ornamenting the church. So,
too, the will of Robert Pynbey, a chantrey priest of Hornby,
shows that, conjointly with another priest, he had established
a chantry, having previously built the south aisle of Hornby
parish church. So, too, in 1490, the sub-dean of York leaves
many legacies to assist in the repairs of the various churches
with which he had been connected. In the same way some
of the chantry certificates of the reign of Edward VI. reveal
the fact that lands had been left to the churchwardens to sell
for the purpose of rebuilding certain parish churches, and
that they had been disposed of to that end.</p>

<p>It must, of course, be remembered that buildings and
repairs of this kind were not lightly undertaken by the
wardens without the full knowledge and consent of the
parishioners generally. For example, in 1512-13 it was
proposed to do some extensive works at St. Mary-at-Hill in
London, and the entry in the churchwardens’ book is as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is determined that they shall go in hand with the building
of the church at March next. Memorandum: that John Allthorpe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
and Stephen Sondyrson have promised to take charge and keep
reckoning to pay all such workmen as shall make the battlements
of our church of brick or stone or lead, as shall be thought best
and determined by Mr. Alderman and the parishioners, and Mr.
Parson is to assist them with his good diligence and wisdom to
the best that he can, for the same: and Thomas Monders is
chosen by the said parish to wait upon the said Stephen and Allthorpe
in their absence and at their commandment for the furtherance
of the same work.”</p>
</div>

<p>The obligation of all to contribute to the common work
of God’s house was well understood, and it was taught in
many books of instructions popular in those days. For
example, in <i>Dives and Pauper</i> the former is made to declare
that “many say, God is in no lond so well served in holy
Church, nor so much worshipped in holy Church, as He is in
this lond of England. For so many fair churches, ne so good
aray in churches, ne so fair service, as many say is in none
other lond as it is in this lond.” <i>Pauper</i> does not deny this,
but thinks that it is perhaps done from a spirit of pomp, “to
have a name and worship thereby in the country, or for envy
that one town hath against another.” <i>Dives</i>, with this lead,
suggests that it might be better if the money thus spent “in
high churches, in rich vestments, in curious windows, and in
great bells,” were given to the poor. But <i>Pauper</i> urges that
this is just what Judas thought, and declares that it is the
common business of all, rich and poor alike, to look to the
beautifying of God’s house.</p>

<p>By law, then, according to the statute of Archbishop
Peckham in 1280, which remained in force till the Reformation,
the parish, broadly speaking, was bound to find all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
pertained to the services—such as vestments, chalice, missal,
processional cross, paschal candle, etc.—and to keep the
fabric and ornaments of the church proper in repair. In
1305 Archbishop Winchelsey somewhat enlarged the scope
of the parish duties.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For the future,” he says, “we will and ordain that the
parishioners be bound to provide all the following: Legend, Antiphonal,
Grayle, Psalter, Tropary, Ordinale, Missal, Manual, Chalice,
the best Vestment with Chasuble, Dalmatic
and Tunicle, and a Cope for the
choir with all their belongings (that is,
amice, girdle, maniple and stole, etc.):
the frontal for the High altar, with three
cloths; three surplices; a rochet; the

the nave of the church, interior and exterior; repairs also in regard
to the images of the crucifix and of the saints and to the glazed
windows; all repairs of books and vestments, when such restorations
shall be necessary.” All other repairs, Archbishop Winchelsey adds,
“of the chancel and of other things not the object of special
custom or agreement, pertain to the Rectors or Vicars, and have
to be done at their expense.”</p>
</div>

</figure>

<p>It did not, however, require any very great rigour on the
part of ecclesiastical authorities to enforce this law. The
various churchwarden accounts and the church inventories
prove beyond dispute that the people of England were only
too anxious to maintain and beautify their parish churches,
and that frequently between neighbouring churches there was
a holy rivalry in this labour of love. To take some examples
of this. The inventory of the parish church of Cranbrook,
in Kent, made in 1509, gives the details of all gifts and
donations, in order that the names of the donors and the
particulars of their benefactions might be remembered. The
value of the presents varies very considerably, but nothing
apparently was too small to be noted. Thus we have a
monstrance of silver gilt, which the wardens value at &#163;20,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
“of Sir Robert Egelyonby’s gift.” In regard to this donor
the inventory says, “This Sir Robert was John Roberts’
priest thirty years, and he never had other service or benefice.”
And it adds, “The said John Roberts was father to
Walter Roberts, Esquire.” Again, one John Hindley “gave
three copes of purple velvet, whereof one was of velvet
upon velvet, with images broidered;” and, <i>ad perpetuam rei
memoriam</i>, adds the inventory, “he was grandfather of Gervase
Hindley of Cushorn, and of Thomas (Hindley) of Cranbrook
Street.” And again, to take another example of these entries,
it is recorded that the “two long candlesticks before our
Lady’s altar fronted with lions, and a towel on the rood of
our Lady’s chancel,” were the gift of “old moder Hopper.”</p>

<p>In the same way, the churchwardens’ accounts of Leverton,
a parish situated in the county of Lincoln about 6 miles from
Boston, evidence the same voluntary effort on the part of
the people to adorn their church. In 1492 William Murr
left money for work at the Great Crucifix and to several
of the altars. In 1495 a great effort was made to procure
another bell, and we find the expenses for preparing the
bell-chamber, for the carriage of the great bell, and for the
hanging of it by one William Wright, of Benington. All
the parish apparently contributed, and the parson promised
10<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> towards the expenses; but when he came to settle,
it was found that some one had paid for him. This was the
above-named William Wright; and as the clergyman’s name
was John Wright, perhaps the kindly thought which prompted
the payment came from some bond of relationship. Three
years later it was determined to build the steeple, and the
parishioners were eager for the work. The owner of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
neighbouring quarry gave leave to take whatever stone was
required. “A tree was bought at Tombe Wood,” and a
carpenter was engaged for the scaffolding and timber work.
The tree was sawn into boards; lime was purchased to make
the mortar, and tubs to mix it in. Later, another tree was
bought and cut up for scaffolding purposes. All was entirely
the work of the parish, and the ordering of everything was
done by the wardens the people had chosen, whilst each one
took a lively and personal interest in the common work.</p>

<p>In 1503 another bell was made, and a deputation of the
parish went to Boston to see it “shot.” The local blacksmith,
Richard Messur, made all the necessary “bolts and
locks,” and attended professionally to see it hung, although
the chief responsibility rested upon John Red, “bellgedor of
Boston,” who had the “schotyng” of the bell, and received
&#163;3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for his work. At the same time the parish paid
for a Sanctus bell, which was made by the local plumber, and
the young men of the parish formed themselves into a school
to be taught how “to toll the bells.” In the same year a
new font was made for the church at Freeston, about three
miles away, and a committee of the parish made two
journeys, one to look at the progress of the work and
another to pass and approve it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowp38" id="i_037" style="max-width: 64em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_037.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">BRACKET WITH SUSPENDED DOVE AND COVER</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For some few years the expenses were normal; but in 1512
the desire to possess more bells again came upon the parish.
In the same year the people purchased “a pair of censer
chains, when the parson was in London,” and they renewed
the device “for hanging up the Sacrament” over the altar.
In 1516 the bells evidently did not ring well, and a man was
brought over from Boston to set them right. In the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
year there are entered expenses for hanging a lamp and for
making “a lectern in the choir.” The following year the
north side of the church was found to stand in need of repair,
and there are expenses
for propping the wall
up during the work.
This year, also, the
parish purchased a new
vestment and a chalice;
and in 1519, after the
repairs, the bishop came
to reconsecrate the
church, and the people
paid his fee of 40<i>s.</i> for
doing so. In 1525 an
item of expense is of
interest: “To Isabel
Frendyke for marking all the lynen clothis: St. Thomas’
with a mark of black sylke +, and O. Lady’s with a M.”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_038.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">SACRAMENTAL DOVE</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In 1526 there was a movement to beautify the rood-screen.
An “alybaster man,” otherwise called “Robert
Brook the carver,” was procured, and money was gathered in
the town for his support, and some who gave no money gave
cheese. William Franckis, one of the parishioners, died this
year, and left a legacy of 46<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to buy “images of alybaster
to be set in ye rood-loft.” There were apparently in all
seventeen images, and “in earneste thereof” the carver was
paid a shilling on account; but when he got to work he
found that he could only do sixteen of the figures for the
46<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, at 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> each. Apparently, however, William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
Franckis had provided for contingencies; he had probably
looked at the vacant niches during the many Sundays he had
knelt in front of the rood, had determined that they must
be all filled, and so had charged his wife Janet to see to it.
At any rate, the widow found the other 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, “that every
stage might be filled.”</p>

<p>And so the parish life at Leverton went on without much
change. The ordinary expenses were met out of the ordinary
receipts, and when anything extraordinary was required the
people were apparently ever ready to come forward to provide
it. In 1528 there is a note to say that “John Bell, quondam
Rector,” on his deathbed gave to the wardens the sum of
&#163;6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to be used upon the church. In 1531 a curious
memorandum is worth recording. It is to this effect: on
October 22, Richard Shepperd, the parson, called a meeting
of the parish, to take into consideration the accounts of the
late wardens. The meeting showed their entire confidence in
the priest and their cordial unanimity with him by asking him
to appoint the wardens for the following year, which he did.
Also it was shown to the meeting that by the last will of Walter
Bowsche, of Leverton, three acres of land had been left to the
parish for the purpose of being sold, in order that with the
proceeds a new cope might be bought. The will was
apparently destroyed by the wardens, and the money
obtained from the sale had been spent upon the church work
in which at the time they were chiefly interested, namely, the
making of bells. The parishioners determined that they
were in conscience bound to rectify this plain breach of
trust, and to make up the money for the new cope. Lastly,
in 1540, the parson, John Wright, presented the parish with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
a suite of red-purple vestments, and in recording this gift the
wardens note in their account-book, “for the which you shall
all specially pray for the souls of William Wright and Elizabeth
his wife,” the father and mother of the donor, “and
other relations, as well them as be alive as them that be
departed to the mercy of God, for whose lives and souls”
these vestments are given “for the honour of God, His most
Blessed Mother, our Lady St. Mary, and all His saints in
heaven, and the blessed matron St. Helen, his patron, to be
used at such principal feasts and times as it shall please the
curates so long as they shall last.”</p>

<p>In this way the names of benefactors and the memory of
their good deeds were ever kept alive in the minds of those
who benefited by their gifts. The parish treasury was not
looked on as so much stock, the accumulation of years, of
haphazard donations without definite history or purpose;
but every article, vestment, banner, hanging, chalice, etc.,
called up some affectionate memory both of the living and
the dead. On high day and feast day, when all that was
best and richest in the parochial treasury was brought forth
to deck the walls and statues and altars, the display of parish
ornaments recalled to the minds of the people assembled
within its walls to worship God the memory of good deeds
done by generations of neighbours for the decoration of their
sanctuary.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The immense treasures in the churches,” writes Dr. Jessopp,
“were the joy and boast of every man and woman and child in
England, who, day by day and week by week, assembled to worship
in the old houses of God which they and their fathers had built, and
whose every vestment and chalice, and candlestick and banner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
organ and bells, and pictures and images, and altar and shrine, they
look upon as their own, and part of their birthright.”</p>
</div>

<p>It might reasonably be supposed that this was true only
of the greater churches; but this is not so. What strikes one
so much in these parish accounts of bygone days is the
richness of even small, out-of-the-way village churches.
Where we would naturally be inclined to look for poverty
and meanness, there is evidence to the contrary. To take
an example or two. Morebath is a small, uplandish, remote
parish of little importance on the borders of Exmoor;
the population, for the most part, have spent their energies
in daily labour to secure the bare necessaries of life, and
riches, at any rate, could never have been abundant. Morebath
may consequently be taken as a fair sample of an
obscure and poor village. For this hamlet we possess full
accounts from the year 1530, and we find that at this time,
and in this very poor, out-of-the-way place, there were no less
than eight separate accounts kept of money intended for
the support of different altars of devotions. For example,
we have the “Stores” of the Chapels of our Lady and
St. George, etc., and the Gilds of the young men and
maidens of the parish. All these were kept and managed
by the lay-elected officials of the societies—confraternities,
I suppose, we should call them—and to their credit are
entered numerous gifts of money and specific gifts of value
of kind, such as cows, and swarms of bees, etc. Most of
them had their little capital funds invested in cattle and
sheep, the rent of which proved a considerable part of their
revenues. In a word, these accounts furnish abundant and
unmistakeable evidence of the active and intelligent interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
in the duty of supporting and adorning their church on the
part of these simple country folk at large. What is true of
this is true of every other similar account to a greater or less
degree, and all these accounts show unmistakeably that the
entire management of these parish funds was in the hands of
the people.</p>

<p>Voluntary rates to clear off obligations contracted for
the benefit of the community—such as the purchase of bells,
the repair of the fabric, and even for the making of roads
and bridges—were raised by the wardens. Collections for
Peter’s pence, for the support of the parish clerk, and for
every variety of church and local purpose, are recorded, and
the spirit of self-help manifested, on every page of these
accounts. To return to Morebath. In 1528 a complete set
of black vestments was purchased at a cost—considerable in
those days—of &#163;6 5<i>s.</i>, and to help in the common work the
vicar gave up certain tithes in wool that he had been in
the habit of receiving. These vestments, by the way, were
only finished and paid for in 1547, just before the changes
under Edward VI. rendered them useless. In 1538 the
parish made a voluntary rate to purchase a new cope, and
the general collections for this purpose produced some
&#163;3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> In 1534 the silver chalice was stolen, and
at once, we are told, “ye yong men and maydens of ye
parysshe dru themselves together, and at ther gyfts and
provysyon they bought in another chalice without any charge
of the parish.” Sums of money, big and small; specific gifts
in kind; the stuff or ornaments needed for vestments, were
apparently always forthcoming when needed. Thus at one
time a new cope is suggested, and Anne Tymwell, of Hayne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
gave the churchwardens her “gown and her ring”; Joan
Tymwell, a cloak and a girdle; and Richard Norman, “seven
sheep and 3 shillings and 4 pence in money,” towards the
cost.</p>

<p>These examples could be multiplied to any extent, but
the above will be sufficient to show the popular working of
mediæval parishioners in support of their church. The same
story of local government, popular interest, and ready self-help,
as well as an unmistakeable spirit of affection for the
parish church as theirs—their very own—is manifested by the
people in every account we possess. Every adult of both
sexes had a voice in the system, and the parson was little
more in this regard than chairman of the village meetings,
and, as I have more than once seen him described, “chief
parishioner.” In the management of the fabric, the service,
and all things necessary for the due performance of these,
the people were not merely called upon to pay, but it is clear
the diocesan authorities evidently left to the parish a wise
discretion. No doubt the higher ecclesiastical officials could
interfere in theory, but in practice interference was obviously
and wisely rare. It will be necessary in a subsequent chapter
to describe the various methods employed to replenish the
parochial exchequer. There was apparently seldom much
difficulty in finding the necessary money, and it will be of
interest to see how it was expended by some further
examples.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter the attention of the reader was
directed mainly to the relations of priest and people to
their parish church. The division of obligation for
the upkeep of chancel and nave by general law and custom
between the parson and his parishioners has been stated
and explained, and the devotion of the people to the work
of maintaining and beautifying God’s house has been
illustrated by various examples. In this chapter it is
proposed to speak of the various parts of the church itself;
and first of <i>the chancel</i>, which was that portion of the sacred
edifice between the altar and the nave, so called because it
was separated from the rest of the church by railings (<i>cancelli</i>).
Frequently in England there was at this point a screen
supporting a figure of our Lord upon the cross, with images
of Mary and John on either side, and from this called the
“Rood Screen.” The size of the chancel naturally varied
according to the importance of the church, but it may be
said to have generally included some stalls or seats for
the assistant clergy and the parish clerks. When, as in
cathedral and conventual churches, this portion was made
larger, it was known as the choir (<i>chorus</i>), from the band<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
of singers, who were originally accommodated in the space
between the people in the nave and the clergy in the
<i>presbyterium</i>, or were grouped round the altar, or perhaps
more frequently in an apse behind it. In process of time
this body of clergy migrated to more convenient positions
in the choir. As already pointed out, the care of the
chancel by law belonged to the rector or vicar, and a
portion of the tithe received by him was supposed to be
devoted to this purpose. The chancel was reserved entirely
for the use of the clergy and for those who ministered at
the altar or took part in the ecclesiastical chant. The prohibition
against lay people sitting in that part of the church
was not unfrequently a cause of difficulty. Simon Langham,
of Ely, in his synodical decrees of 1364, prohibits the practice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lay people,” he says, “are not to stand or sit amongst the
clerks in the chancel during the celebration of divine service, unless
it is done to show reverence (to some person), or for some other
reasonable and obvious reason; but this is allowed for the patrons
of the churches only.”</p>
</div>

<p>A letter on the subject, addressed to one of his clergy
by the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, somewhere in the
fourteenth century, shows that it was difficult sometimes to
enforce this law.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Not only the decrees of the holy fathers,” he says, “but the
approved existing customs of the Church order that the place in
which the clerks sing and serve God according to their offices be
divided by screens from that in which the laity devoutly pray. In
this way the nave of the church, which is called the <i>Sancta Sanctorum</i>,
is alone to be open to lay people, in order that, in the time of divine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
service, clerics be not mixed up with lay people, and more especially
with women, nor have communication with them, for in this way
devotion may easily be diminished.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” the bishop continues in this letter, written to a
rector, “in your church report says that some laymen have taken the
seats of the clergy in your chancel and still obstinately refuse to give
them up. If this be so, the names are to be published from the
pulpit, and if after that they still persist, the delinquents are to be
punished according to the statutes.”</p>

CENTURY</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><i>The Altar.</i>—The most prominent feature of the chancel,
and indeed of the whole church, as being the very purpose
for which the entire building was erected, and the centre
round which all the services were performed, was the high
altar (<i>summum</i>, or <i>majus altare</i>). “It is that,” says the
gloss upon a constitution of Archbishop Winchelsea, “to
honour which the church is dedicated,” and it is placed
in the choir as in the most solemn part of the building.
Originally, if we may judge from existing illuminations, the
altar in English churches stood a little away from the
eastern wall of the church, and had over it a canopy supported
on pillars, between which curtains were suspended
on rods, and drawn during the celebration of the sacred
mysteries. Sometimes, as at West Grinstead, for example,
behind the altar in the wall of the church was an ambry,
or cupboard, to contain the consecrated vessels and the
missal, etc., for Mass. Over the altar was generally suspended
some covering or canopy as a manifestation of the
reverence due to the place of Sacrifice, and the churchwardens’
accounts contain frequent mention of expenses to
repair and renew this <i>cælatura</i>; for by custom, if not by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
law, this was done at the cost of the parish. Under this
canopy was suspended a vessel of ivory or silver, covered
by a cone-like tabernacle or by a silken veil, hanging frequently
from a crown of metal, in which was the reserved
Blessed Sacrament. To this ancient practice Becon, in <i>The
Displaying of the Popish Mass</i>, alludes, when he says, “Ye
go unto the midst of the altar, and looking up to the pyx,
where ye think your God to be, and making solemn
courtesy, like womanly Joan, ye say the <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>.”
And again, “Ye make solemn courtesy to your little idol
that hangeth over the altar.” This was one of the practices
which were done away by the changes under Edward VI.,
and which the insurgents in Devon, in their fourth article,
demanded should be restored: “We will have the Sacrament
hang over the altar, and there to be worshipped.”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_048.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">PYX, AND CANOPY, OPEN</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the wills of the fifteenth century we have instances
of rich stuffs and silks being left for the covering of the
Sacred Vessel, and of gold and jewels for the pix itself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
In a will of Elizabeth Bigod, for instance, is the following
item: “To the monastery of Croxton my chain of gold
to make a pyx for the Sacrament of the
altar, and there to be graven about the said
pyx this: <i>Abbot and convent of the same place,
pray for the soul of Dame Elizabeth Bigod</i>.”
In 1496 “Mr. Doctor Hatclyff, parson,” of
St. Mary-at-Hill in London, gave into the
hands of the wardens “a pyx clothe for the
high auter, of sipers frenged with gold, with
knoppis of golde and sylke of Spaynesshe
makyng.” And at the same time two other
coverings were made for this pyx; one of
“green sylk and red, with knoppis sylver
and gylt with corners goyng, of Mistress
Duklyng’s gyffte,” and the other “of red
velvelt with three crowns of laton.” How
carefully these presents were preserved may
be judged by an entry of 2<i>d.</i> in the accounts
of 1513—seventeen years later—“for mending
the pyx cloth that Mistress Duklyng gave
the High Altar.”</p>

</figure>

<p>The frontal of the altar made of silk or velvet, or in
some instances of metal with jewels, was by law to be
found by the parishioners; and numerous gifts are recorded
of rich stuffs and velvets to vest the altar with becoming
honour. The same in practice may be said of the other
ornaments, which, although perhaps in strict law the
parishioners were not bound to provide, they nevertheless
did find very generally and very generously. The fee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
payable to the bishop for the consecration of an altar after
rebuilding or reconstruction is found as an item of expense
in the accounts of the parish wardens. So, too, are the
more constant fees, for the blessing of altar cloths and other
altar linen and the hallowing of vestments, paid to the parson
by the parish, as well as the occasional payment to a bishop
for the consecration of the parish chalice.</p>

<p>On the altar between the two big candlesticks stood the
crucifix. The author of <i>Dives and Pauper</i> explains why
this should be upon the table of every altar in the following
dialogue:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When a priest sayeth his Mass at the altar, commonly there is
an image before him, and commonly it is a crucifix, stone, or tree,
or portrayed”—(that is, of course, in stone, wood, or painting).</p>

<p>“<i>Dives.</i>—Why more a crucifix than another thing?</p>

<p>“<i>Pauper.</i>—For every Mass saying is a special mind-making of
Christ’s passion.</p>

<p>“<i>Dives.</i>—The skyle is good; say forth.</p>

<p>“<i>Pauper.</i>—Before the image the priest says his Mass and
maketh the highest prayer that Holy Church can desire for salvation
of the quick and the dead; he holds up his hands, he leneth (<i>i.e.</i> bows
down), he kneels, and all the worship he can do, he does. Overmore,
he offereth up the highest sacrifice and the best offering that
any heart can devise; that is Christ, God’s Son from Heaven, under
the form of bread and wine. All this worship doth the priest at
Mass afore the thing, and I hope there is no man nor woman so
lewd that he will say that the priest singeth his Mass nor maketh his
prayer, nor offers up God’s Son, Christ Himself, to the thing.</p>

<p>“<i>Dives.</i>—God forbid.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the altar, besides the two big candlesticks and the
crucifix, were, as we learn from some inventories, three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
smaller candlesticks for low Mass—two to hold the tapers
lighted during the whole service, and one for that which
was ordered to be burning during the Canon, or more
solemn part of the Mass. Most frequently hangings were
suspended at the back and sides of the altar, and this was
a favourite form of gift left to the churches in the wills
of ladies in the fifteenth century. In some accounts and
inventories mention is made of an “altar beam,” evidently
used for the purpose of placing candles upon it, and
possibly also images and relics. Whether it was behind
the altar, or supported by columns in front, or serving to
bear up the canopy, is not certain. Canon Scott Robertson,
writing about mediæval Folkestone, suggests that it was at
the back of the altar, and that it was somewhat similar to
what Gervase described at Canterbury in the twelfth century.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At the eastern horns of the altar were two wooden columns,
highly ornamented with gold and silver, which supported a great
beam, the ends of which beam rested upon the capitals of the two
pillars. The beam placed across the church and decorated with
gold supported the Majesty of the Lord, the images of St. Dunstan
and St. Elphege, also seven shrines, decorated with gold and silver
and filled with the relics of many saints. Between the columns
stood a cross, gilt, in the centre of which were sixty transparent
crystals in a circle.”</p>
</div>

<p>Two other features very general in the south side of
every chancel must be noted—the <i>sedilia</i>, or seats for the
ministers at the altar, and the <i>piscina</i>, or place where the
vessels or cruets of wine and water were placed for use at
Mass, and which was furnished with a basin, from which the
water used to wash the priest’s hands, etc., could drain away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
into the earth of the consecrated cemetery. Originally the
word <i>piscina</i> meant, of course, a “fish-pond,” but came to
mean, even in classical writers of the silver age, a basin or
bath.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">DOUBLE PISCINA, COWLINGE,

</figure>

<p>In the north wall of English churches, not unfrequently
there was a niche for the lamp, which was always kept
burning when the Blessed Sacrament was reserved on the
altar. A good example of such a niche was discovered some
years ago during the restoration of the parish church of West
Grinstead. The smoke from the burning lamp in this
instance had been allowed to escape by means of some loose
stones leading to the eaves of the chancel wall, and when
discovered the black of the smoke was still upon the upper
stones of the niche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Lastly, in recalling the chief features of a pre-Reformation
chancel, what is called in the Constitution of Archbishop
Winchelsea “the principal image” must not be forgotten.
This image was that of the saint or saints, to whom the
church was dedicated, and it was one of the ornaments which
the parish was specially called upon to provide. From the
wording of the law it might have a place anywhere in the
chancel, but probably it would have stood in a niche on one
side of the altar; or, in the case of there being two patrons,
the statues would have been placed on either side.</p>

<p>Frequent mention is made in wills of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries of the desire of testators to beautify the
chancels of the churches in which during life they had
worshipped. Thus William Graystoke, of Wakefield, left to
the church there in 1508 “a cloth of Arras work, sometime
hanging in his hall”: &#163;10 “to the stalling of the said church:
two pairs of censers, and &#163;20 for new choir books.” Another
testator, Thomas Wood, of Hull, who had been a draper and
sheriff and mayor of his city, on his death bequeathed to
Trinity Church</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“one of my best beds of Arreys work, upon condition that after
my decease I will that the said bed shall yearly cover my grave at
my <i>Dirge</i> and <i>Masse</i>, done in the said Trinity Church with note
for evermore; and also I will that the same bed be hung yearly in
the said church at the feast of St. George the Martyr, among the
other worshipfulle beds; and when the said beds be taken down and
delivered, then I will that the same bed be re-delivered into the
vestry and there to remain with my cope of gold.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another testator, in 1504, this time a priest, and the
rector of Lowthorpe in Yorkshire, leaves to the church of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Catton a bed-cover with big figures on it, to lie before the
high altar on the chief feasts; and another bed-cover with
the figure of a lion, to lie before the high altar of Lowthorpe,
on all the great festivals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowp44" id="i_055" style="max-width: 80em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_055.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">OUTSIDE ENTRANCE TO ROOD-LOFT, ST. JOHN’S, WINCHESTER</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In some instances legacies are left to beautify the existing
altar, to have paintings made for it, or images carved upon it.
In one case a man leaves a notable sum for those days to have
two paintings executed abroad to adorn the chancel. A very
curious bequest was made to the church of Holy Trinity,
Hull, in 1502, by Thomas Golsman, an alderman of the city.
“I leave,” he says, “&#163;10 in honour of the Sacrament, to make
at the high altar angels to descend and ascend to the roof of
the church at the Elevation of the Body and Blood of Christ,
as they have at Lynne;” that is, the angels descend until the
end of the singing of the <i>Ne nos inducas in tentationem</i> of the
<i>Pater noster</i>, when they ascend. The chancel was very
frequently, if not generally in England, divided from the nave
by the rood with its screen. The <i>rood</i>, meaning a gallows,
or cross or crucifix, probably consisted originally of the
crucifix, which stood over the entrance into the choir, while
the screen was the developed low walls which shut in the
chancel, in or on which on either side were the pulpits or
ambos, from which the Epistle and Gospel were chanted in
solemn masses. The “rood-beam,” or “rood-screen,” or “rood-loft,”
was probably the introduction of the twelfth century.
In its simplest form of a “beam,” the rood supported a great
crucifix, which was often in the wills of the fifteenth century
and other documents called the <i>Summus Crucifix</i>; and
generally the two figures of the Blessed Virgin and St. John
were represented as standing at the foot of the cross, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
reference to John xix. 26. Besides this, lights were frequently
placed upon the beam, and Ducange, under the word
<i>Trabes</i>, gives an example of a mediæval writer who mentions
fifty candles as placed on the “rood-beam.” In the form of
its highest development the rood took the shape of “the
Screen” as seen in many of our English cathedrals, or in
French churches under the name of <i>Jubé</i>. In parish churches
in England it was usually called a “rood-loft,” and took the
shape of a light screen, generally of wood, supporting a
wooden gallery, on which was the great crucifix, etc., and to
which access was obtained by a flight of steps, often in one
of the piers of the chancel arch and entered by a door
generally from within the church, but certainly sometimes
from without.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp57" id="i_056fp" style="max-width: 80em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_056fp.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">SCREEN. WITHYCOMBE. SOMERSET</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The work of carving and ornamenting the rood-lofts in
the parish churches was constant up to the very eve of the
Reformation, and bequests are very frequently met with in
the wills of that period for this end, and to keep up the rood-lights.
At St. Mary-at-Hill, for instance, in 1496-7 there
are a set of accounts headed “costes paid for the pyntyng of
the Roode, with karvyng and odir costes also”; and amongst
the items is “to the karvare for makyng of 3 dyadems—and
for mendyng the Roode, the cross, the Mary and John, the
crowne of thorn, with all other fawtes, <i>Summa</i> 10 shillings”;
and yet another item was for the painting and gilding.
Towards these and other expenses of “setlyng up of the
Roode” the parishioners contributed in a special collection.
The legacy for beautifying and completing the rood at
Leverton has already been noticed. To the “Rood” in
one parish church a lady in her will leaves “my heart of gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
with a diamond in the midst.” In 1510, at St. Margaret’s,
Westminster, &#163;10 was left “towards making a new rood-loft”;
and the work was still apparently going on in 1516,
when another donor left &#163;38 for the same object. Lastly,
in the churchwardens’ accounts of St. Edmund’s, Salisbury,
there are entered expenses for the light kept burning before
the rood; at which place, for example, in 1480 the candlemaker
was specially employed in making “the rood-light.”
A curious entry in the accounts of the parish church of St.
Petrock’s, Exeter, shows how this light at the rood was kept
up: “Ordinans made by the eight men for gathering to the
wax silver for the light kept before the high cross, which
says, that every man and his wife to the wax shall pay
yerely one peny, and every hired servant that takes wages
a half peny, and every other persons at Easter, taking no
wages, a farthing.” In some places, as, for example, Cratfield,
there was a “rowell,” or wheel or corona of candles, kept
burning on feast-days before the rood.</p>

<p>The special destruction of the roods of the English
churches in the early stages of the Reformation under
Edward VI., and again under Elizabeth, causes many to
think that the reverence shown to this representation of our
Crucified Lord, probably the most prominent object visible
in the churches, was not only excessive, but mistaken in
its kind. If that were so, it must at least be allowed that
the Church’s teaching on the matter was clear and definite.
The author of <i>Dives and Pauper</i>, for example, says that the
representations of the Crucified Christ—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“ben ordeyned to steryn men’s mynds to thinke on Crist’s Incarnation
and on hys passyon and on his levyng ... for oft man is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
more sterryed be syght than be heryng or redyng—also thei ben
ordeyned to ben a tokne and a boke to the lewyd people that thei
mon redyn in ymagery and peyntour that clerkes redyn in boke.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then, after describing what thoughts the sight of the
crucifix should bring to the mind of the beholder, <i>Pauper</i>
goes on—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In this manner I pray thee read thy boke and fall down to the
ground and thank thy God that would do so much for thee, and
worship him above all things—not the stock, stone nor tree, but him
that died on the tree for thy sin and thy sake: so that thou kneel
if thou wilt afore the image, not to the image; do thy worship afore
the image, afore the thing, not to the thing; make thy prayer afore
the thing, not to the thing, for it seeth thee not, heareth thee not,
understandeth thee not. Make thy offering if thou wilt afore the
thing, but not to the thing; make thy pilgrimage not to the thing nor
for the thing, for it may not help thee, but to him and for him that
the thing representeth. For if thou do it for the thing or to the
thing thou doest idolatry.”</p>
</div>

<p>We now pass from the chancel to the body of the church.
The nave and aisles—if there were any—were in a special
way under the care of the wardens chosen by the people.
There seems to be little doubt that very generally, although
perhaps not universally, the walls of the parish churches were
painted with subjects illustrating Bible history, the lives of
the saints, or the teaching of the sacramental doctrine of the
Church. In the same way, although of course in a lesser
degree, the windows were often filled with glass stained with
pictures conveying the same lessons to the young and the
unlettered. These were, as they were called, “the books
of the poor and the illiterate,” who, by looking at these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
representations, could learn the story of God’s dealings with
mankind, and could draw encouragement to strive manfully
in God’s service, from the example of the deeds of God’s
chosen servants.</p>

<p>The work of beautifying the parish churches by wall
decorations and painted windows was the delight of the
parishioners themselves, for it all helped to make their
churches objects both of beauty and interest. To take but
one example: the church of St. Neots possesses many stained-glass
windows, placed in their present positions between 1480
and 1530. The inscriptions inserted below the lights testify
that most of them were paid for by individual members of
the parish, but in the case of three it appears that groups
of people joined together to beautify their church. Thus, a
Latin label below one says that “the youths of the parish of
St. Neots” erected the window in 1528; a second says that,
the following year, the young maidens emulated the example
of their brothers; and the “mothers” of the parish finished
the third window in 1530.</p>

<p>Besides the high altar in the chancel, there were, from
early times, few churches that did not have one or more, and
sometimes many smaller or side altars. These were dedicated
to various saints, and from the fifteenth century, and even
earlier, they were used as chantries or guild chapels. The
priests serving them were supported by the annuity left by
some deceased benefactor to the parish church, or by a stipend
paid by the guild to the priest who acted as its chaplain, or
again by the private generosity of some benefactor. These
chapels were frequently richly decorated, furnished with hangings,
and supplied with their own vestments and altar furniture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
by their founders or by the guilds that supported them. To
take an example: In 1471 an indenture or agreement was
made between Mr. William Vowelle, master of the town of
Wells, and the two wardens of our Lady’s altar in St. Cuthbert’s
Church, and John Stowell, freemason, for making the
front of the Jesse at the said altar. The work was to cost
&#163;40 (probably more than &#163;500 of our money), and the
mason was to be paid 40<i>s.</i> a week, with &#163;5 to be kept in
hand till the completion of the work. To take another
example: at Heydon, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, the
south aisle was dedicated to St. Catherine, and there is an
item of expense in the churchwardens’ accounts showing the
existence of a painted altar, an image of the saint, and a
kneeling-desk in front of it.</p>

<p>In the accounts of St. Mary-at-Hill, where there were
many such side chapels, there is an order of the wardens,
made in 1518, “that every priest shall sing with his founder’s
vestments, and that their chest is to be at the altar’s end,
next where they sing.” In some of these small chapels
there were statues, before which lights were kept burning by
the devotion of various members, or groups of members, of a
parish. Thus at Henley-on-Thames there were seven chapels
and two altars in the nave, besides the high altar in the
chancel. Lights were kept burning before the rood, the
altar of Jesus, and the altar of the Holy Trinity. In 1482
the warden and the commonalty ordained that the chaplain
in the chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary say Mass every day
at six o’clock, and the chantry priest of St. Katherine’s
chapel at eight o’clock. In these accounts are entered the
receipts and expenses of the Guild of the Holy Name, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
amongst the rest is an entry “for painting the image of
Jesus and gilding it.” The most curious entry, however,
in this book of accounts is that of a gift to secure the perpetual
maintenance of “our Lady’s light.” This was a set
of jewels, given to the
churchwardens in 1518 by
Lady Jones. They were
apparently very fine, and
were to be let out by the
wardens for the use of
brides at weddings. The
sum charged for the hire
was to be 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for anyone
outside the town, and
20<i>d.</i> for any burgess of
Henley. Portions of what
is called “the Bridegeer”
were let at lower figures; but in one year the wardens
received as much as 46<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> from this source of income.
At the Reformation the jewels were sold for &#163;10 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<figure class="figright illowp75" id="i_061" style="max-width: 25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">CORONA OF LIGHTS, ST. MARTIN DE
TROYES—FIFTEENTH CENTURY</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The floors of our churches, until late in the fifteenth
century, were not generally so encumbered with pews or
sittings, as they became later on, but were open spaces covered
with rushes. The church accounts show regular expenses for
straw, rushes, or, on certain festivals, box and other green
stuff wherewith to cover the pavement. This carpet was
renewed two or three times a year, and one almost shudders
to think of the state of unpleasant dirt revealed on those
periodical cleanings. Some accounts show regular payments
made to “the Raker” on these occasions, whilst the purchase,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
in 1469, of “three rat-traps” for the church of St. Michael’s,
Cornhill, suggests that the rush covering must have been a
happy hunting-ground for rats, mice, and suchlike vermin.
In some places, however, mats were provided by the wardens,
as at St. Margaret’s, Westminster, where, in 1538, 4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> was
paid to provide “matts for the parishioners to kneel on when
they reverenced their Maker.” So too, at St. Mary-at-Hill,
London, there was a mat in the confession pew, and others
were provided for the choristers, whilst we read of the expenditure
of 4<i>d.</i> “for three mats of wikirs, boght for prestis
and clerkis.”</p>

<p>The provision of fixed seats in parish churches, for the use
of the people generally, was a late introduction. The practice
of allowing seats to be appropriated to individuals was in
early days distinctly discouraged. In 1287, for instance,
Bishop Quevil, of Exeter, in his synodical Constitutions, condemns
the practice altogether.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have heard,” he says, “that many quarrels have arisen
amongst members of the same parish, two or three of whom have
laid claim to one seat. For the future, no one is to claim any
sitting in the church as his own, with the exception of noble people
and the patrons of churches. Whoever first comes to church to
pray, let him take what place he wishes in which to pray.”</p>
</div>

<p>This, of course, refers to a few seats or benches, and not
to regular sittings or pews, which were begun to be set up in
the English churches only in the middle of the fifteenth
century, and in some not till late in the sixteenth. At
Bramley church, for example, the wardens did not begin “to
seat” the nave before 1538; at Folkestone some pews were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
in existence as early as in 1489; in 1477-8 the wardens of
St. Edmund’s parish church, Salisbury, assigned certain seats
to individuals at a yearly rent of 6<i>d.</i>; and even before that
time, in 1455, seats were rented at St. Ewen’s church, Bristol.
Apparently, once introduced, the churchwardens soon found
out the advantages of being able to derive income from the
pew or seat rents, especially as from some of the accounts
it is evident that the seats were first made with money
obtained at special collections for the purpose, as at St.
Mary’s the Great, Cambridge, in 1518. In the first instance,
apparently, the seats were assigned only to the women-folk,
but the great convenience was, no doubt, quickly realised
by all, and the use became general after a very short time.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">FONT, ST. MICHAEL’S, SUTTON BONNINGTON,

</figure>

<p>One of the most conspicuous objects in every parish
church was its <i>Font</i>. This stood at the west end of the
church, and frequently in a place set apart as a baptistery.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
From the thirteenth century it was ordered, in the Constitutions
of St. Edmund of Canterbury, that every font
must be made of stone or some other durable material, and
that it was to be covered and locked, so as to keep the
baptismal water pure, and prevent any one except the priest
from meddling with what had been consecrated on Easter
Eve with Holy Oils and with solemn ceremony. Great care
was enjoined on the clergy
to keep the Blessed Sacrament,
the Holy Oils, and
the baptismal water safe
under lock and key. For,
says the gloss on this ordinance
in Lyndwood, keys
exist so that things may
be kept securely; and he
that is negligent about the
keys would appear to be
negligent about what the
keys are supposed to guard.
By the ordinary law of the Church a font could only be set
up in a parish church; and in the case of chapels of ease,
and other places in a parochial district, where it was lawful
to satisfy other ecclesiastical obligations, for baptism the
child had generally to be brought to the mother church.
The instances in which permission was granted for the erection
of any font in a chapel are very rare, and leave was never
given without the consent of the rector of the parish church.
Thus a grant was made in the fourteenth century to Lord
Beauchamp to erect a font for baptisms in his chapel at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Beauchamp, provided that the rector agreed that it would not
harm his parochial rights.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">HOLY WATER STOUP, WOOTTON
COURTNEY, SOMERSET</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Leading into the church very generally there was a
covered approach, greater or less in size, called the porch,
from the Latin <i>porta</i>, “a door or gate.” This was usually at
the south side of the church, and sometimes it was built in
two stories, the upper one being
used as a priest’s chamber, with
a window looking into the church.
In some cases this chamber was
used as a safe repository for the
parish property and muniments.
In the lower porch, at the side
of the church door, was the stoup,
usually in a stone niche, with a
basin to contain the Holy Water.
With this people were taught to
cross themselves before entering
God’s house, the water being a
symbol of the purity of soul with
which they ought to approach the place where His Majesty
dwelt. The mutilated remains of those niches, destroyed
when the practice was forbidden in the sixteenth century,
may still frequently be seen in the porches of pre-Reformation
churches. Sometimes it would seem that there was
attached to the water stoup a sprinkler to be used for the
Blessed Water—as, for example, at Wigtoft, a village church
near Boston, in Lincolnshire, where the churchwardens purchased
“a chain of iron with a Holy Water stick at the
south door.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>The land round about the church was also in the custody
of the people’s wardens. It was called the <i>Cemetery</i>, from
the word <i>cœmeterium</i>, “a dormitory,” it being in the Christian
sense the sleeping-place of the dead who had died in the
Lord. It was likewise spoken of as the “church-yard,” or
under the still more happy appellation of “God’s acre.”
From an early period attempts were made from time to time
to put a stop to the practice of holding fairs in the cemetery,
or to prevent anything being sold in the porches of churches
or in the precincts. Bishops prohibited the practice by Constitutions,
and imposed all manner of spiritual penalties for
disobedience. By the Synod of Exeter, in 1267, Bishop
Quevil ordered that all the cemeteries in his diocese should
be enclosed securely, and that no animal was to be allowed
pasturage on the grass that grew in them, and even the
clergy were warned of the impropriety of permitting their
cattle to graze in “the holy places, which both civil and
canon law ordered to be respected.” For this reason, the
bishop continues, “all church cemeteries must be guarded
from all defilement, both because they are holy (in themselves)
and because they are made holy by the relics of the
Saints.”</p>

<p>The reason for this belief in the holy character of
cemeteries is set out clearly in a letter of Bishop Edyndon, in
1348, where he says that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“the Catholic Church spread over the world believes in the resurrection
of the bodies of the dead. These have been sanctified by the
reception of the Sacraments, and are consequently buried, not in
profane places, but in specially enclosed and consecrated cemeteries,
or in churches, where with due reverence they are kept, like the relics
of the Saints, till the day of the resurrection.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>The trees that grew within the precincts of the cemetery
were at times a fertile cause of dispute between the priest
and his people. Were they the property of the parson or
of the parish? And could they be cut down at the will of
either? In the thirteenth century, when the charge of looking
after the churchyards was regarded as weighing chiefly on
the clergy, it was considered that to repair the church—either
chancel or nave—the trees growing in them might be cut.
Otherwise, as they had been planted for the purpose of protecting
the churches from damage by gales, they were to
be left to grow and carry out the end for which they had
been placed there. Archbishop Peckham had previously laid
down the law that, although the duty of keeping the enclosure
of the cemetery rested upon the parishioners, what
grew upon holy ground being holy, the clergy had the right
to regard the grass and trees and all that grew in the
cemetery as rightly belonging to them. In cutting anything,
however, the archbishop warned the clergy to remember
that these things were intended to ornament and protect
God’s house, and that nothing should be cut without reason.
However the question of the ownership of the trees growing
in churchyards may have been regarded by the parishioners,
there are evidences to show that they did not hesitate to
adorn their burial-places with trees and shrubs when needed.
At St. Mary’s, Stutterton, for instance, in 1487, the churchwardens
purchased seven score of plants from one John
Folle, of Kyrton, and paid for “expenses of settyng of ye
plants, 16<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p>The sacred character of consecrated cemeteries was recognized
by the law. Bracton says that “they are free and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
absolute from all subjection, as a sacred thing, which is only
amongst the goods of God—whatever is dedicated and consecrated
to God with rites and by the pontiffs, never to
return afterward to any private uses.” And amongst these
he names “cemeteries dedicated, whether the dead are
buried therein or not, because if those places have once been
dedicated and consecrated to God, they ought not to be converted
again to human uses.” Indeed, “even if the dead are
buried there without the place having been dedicated or consecrated,
it will still be a sacred place.”</p>

<p>The ceremony by which the mediæval churchyard was
consecrated was performed by the bishop of the diocese, or
some other bishop, by his authority and in his name. The
fees were to be paid by the parish; and the parochial accounts
give examples of this expense having been borne by the
wardens. Thus at Yatton, in 1486, the churchyard was
greatly enlarged, and, when the new wall had been constructed,
the bishop came over and consecrated the ground.
The parish entertained him and his ministers at dinner,
and paid the episcopal fee, which was 33<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> One of the
expenses of this ceremony, noted down by the churchwardens,
was, “We paid the old friar that was come to sing
for the parish, 8<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p>In the churchyards thus dedicated to God were set up
stone crosses or crucifixes, as a testimony to the faith and
the hope in the merits of Christ’s death, of those who lay
there waiting for the resurrection. The utmost reverence
for these sacred places was ever enjoined upon all. Children,
according to Myrc, were to be well instructed on this
point—</p>

<p>In concluding this brief survey of the material parts of
pre-Reformation churches, it is impossible not mentally to
contrast the picture of these sacred places, as revealed in
the warden’s accounts, the church inventories and other
documents, with the bare and unfurnished buildings they
became after what Dr. Jessopp has called “the great pillage.”
Even the poorest and most secluded village sanctuary was
in the early times overflowing with wealth and objects of
beauty, which loving hands had gathered to adorn God’s
house, and to make it, as far as their means would allow,
the brightest spot in their little world, and beyond doubt the
pride of all their simple, true hearts. This is no picture of
our imagination, but sober reality, for the details can be all
pieced together from the records which survive. Just as a
shattered stained-glass window may with care be put together
again, and may help us to understand something of what it
must have been in the glory of its completeness, so the
fragments of the story of the past, which can be gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
together after the destruction and decay of the past centuries,
are capable of giving some true, though perhaps poor, idea
of the town and village parish churches in pre-Reformation
days. “There is not a parish church in the Kingdom,”
writes a Venetian traveller of England in 1500,—“there is not
a parish church in the Kingdom so mean as not to possess
crucifixes, candlesticks, censers, patens, and cups of silver.”
What is most remarkable about the documents that have
come down to us, and which are mere chance survivals amid
the general wreck, is the consistent story they tell of the
universal and intelligent interest taken by the people of
every parish as a whole in beautifying and supporting their
churches. In a real and true sense, which may be perhaps
strange to us in these later times, the parish church was <i>their</i>
church. Their life, as will be seen in subsequent chapters,
really centred round it, and they one and all were intimately
connected with its management. The building was their
care and their pride; the articles of furniture and plate, the
vestments and banners and hangings, all had their own well-remembered
story, and were regarded, as in truth they were,
as the property of every man, woman, and child of the
particular village or district.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE PARISH CLERGY</p>


<p>The head of every parish in pre-Reformation days
was the priest. He might be a <i>rector</i> or <i>vicar</i>,
according to his position in regard to the benefice;
but in either case he was the resident ecclesiastical head
of the parochial district. The word “parson,” in the sense
of a dignified personage—“the person of the place”—was,
in certain foreign countries, applied in the eleventh century,
in its Latin form of <i>persona</i>, to any one holding the parochial
cure of souls. English legal writers, such as Coke and
Blackstone, have stated the civil law signification of the
word as that of any “person” by whom the property of
God, the Patron Saint, the church or parish was held, and
who could sue or be sued at law in respect to this property.
In ecclesiastical language, at any rate in England, according
to Lyndwood, the word “parson” was synonymous with
“rector.”</p>

<p>Besides the rector or parson and the vicar, several other
classes of clergy were frequently to be met with in mediæval
parishes. Such were curates, chantry priests, chaplains,
stipendiary priests, and sometimes even deacons and subdeacons.
About each of these and their duties and obligations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
it will be necessary to speak in turn, but before doing so
something may usefully be said about the clergy generally,
and about their education, obligations, and method of life.
From the earliest times the clerical profession was open
to all ranks and classes of the people. Possibly, and even
probably, the English landlords of the fourteenth or fifteenth
centuries were only too glad to bestow livings, of which they
had the right of presentation, upon younger sons or relations,
who had been educated with this end in view. But in those
same centuries there is ample evidence that the ranks of
the clergy were recruited from the middle classes, and even
from the sons of serfs, who had to obtain their overlord’s
leave and pay a fine to him for putting their children to
school, and thus taking them from the land to which they
were by birth <i>adscripti</i>, or bound. Mr. Thorold Rogers
has given instances of the exaction of these fines for sending
sons to school. In one example 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> was paid for leave
to put an eldest son <i>ad scholas</i> with a view of his taking
orders; in another 5<i>s.</i> was paid, in 1335, for a similar
permission for a younger son. In the diocesan registers,
also, episcopal dispensations <i>de defectu natalium</i> are frequent,
and show that a not inconsiderable number of the English
clergy sprang from the class of “natives” of the soil, or
serfs, upon whom the lord of the manor had a claim.
Examples also could be given of a bishop allowing his
“native” (<i>nativus meus</i>) permission to take sacred orders
and to hold ecclesiastical benefices—acts of kindness on
the bishops’ part shown to some promising son of one of
the serfs of the episcopal domains.</p>

<p>The practice of introducing into the body of the clergy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
even those sprung from the lower ranks of life was not
altogether popular, and the author of <i>The Vision of Piers
Plowman</i> has left a record of the existing prejudice on the
subject. He thinks that “bondmen and beggars’ children
belong to labour, and should serve lords’ sons,” and that
things are much amiss when every cobbler sends “his son
to schole” and “each beggar’s brat” learns his book, “so
that beggar’s brat a Bishop that worthen among the peers
of the land prese to sytten ... and his sire a sowter
(cobbler) y-soiled with grees, his teeth with toyling of
leather battered as a saw.”</p>

<p>In 1406 the more liberal spirit of encouraging learning
wherever it was found to exist asserted itself, and by a
statute of the English Parliament of that date it was enacted
that “every man or woman, of what state or condition he
be, shall be free to set their son or daughter to take learning
at any school that pleaseth them within the realm.” That
such schools existed in the past in greater numbers than
has been thought likely does not now appear open to doubt.
Besides the teaching to be obtained at the cathedrals,
religious houses, and well-known grammar schools, the
foundations of education were furnished by numerous other
smaller places, taught by priests up and down the country.
This is proved by the numbers of students who came up
to the Universities for their higher work at the age of
fourteen or so, after they had been prepared elsewhere,
and the numbers of whom fell off almost to a vanishing
point on the destruction of the religious houses, and the
demolition of the smaller schools, under cover of the Act
for dissolving Chantries, etc. In the Chantry certificates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
mention is made of numerous parochial schools taught by
priests, who also served the parish in other ways, or by
clerks supported by money left for the purpose of giving
free education. These proofs appear on the face of the
certificates, in order that a plea might be made for their
exemption from the operation of the general dissolution
of chantries and guilds; it is needless to add that the
plea had no effect. In some places, too, as for example
at Morpeth and Alnwick and Durham, a second school
of music, called the “song school,” was kept. At the
latter place a chantry was founded in the cathedral for
two priests “to pray and to keep free schools, one of
grammar and one of song, in the city of Durham, for all
manner of children that should repair to the said schools,
and also to distribute yearly alms to poor people.” At
Lavenham, in Suffolk, a priest was paid by the parish to
“teach the children of the town” and to act as “secondary”
to the curate.</p>

<p>By the will of Archbishop Rotheram, in 1500, the foundation
of a college in his native place was laid. In this will
the archbishop, after saying that he had been born at
Rotheram, gives an interesting biographical note about
his early years—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To this place a teacher of grammar coming, by what chance,
but I believe it was God’s grace that brought him thither, taught me
and other youths, by which others with me attained to higher (paths
of life). Wherefore wishing to show my gratitude to our Saviour,
and to celebrate the cause of my (success in life), and lest I should
seem to be ungrateful and forgetful of God’s benefits and from
whence I came, I have determined in the first place to establish
there a teacher of grammar to instruct all without charge.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>Archbishop Rotheram’s case was not singular. Bishop
Latimer, in one of his sermons before Edward VI., gives
an account of his early life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My father,” he says, “was a yeoman, and had no lands of his
own; only he had a farm of three or four pounds by the year at
the uttermost, and hereupon he tilled so much as kept half a dozen
men. He had a walk for a hundred sheep, and my mother milked
thirty kine. He was able and did find the king a harness and his
horse. I remember that I buckled on his harness when he went to
Blackheath field. He kept me to school, or else I had not been
able to have preached before the King’s majesty now.”</p>
</div>

<p>An ordinance of the diocese of Exeter in the synod of
Bishop Quevil seems also to suggest that schools of some
kind existed in most cities and towns. He had always
understood, he says, that the benefice of the “Holy Water
bearer” was in the beginning instituted in order to give
poor clerks something to help them to school, “that they
might become more fit and prepared for higher posts.”
In this belief the bishop directs that in all churches, not
more than ten miles distant from the schools of the cities
and towns of his diocese, the “benefices” of the “Holy
Water bearers” should always be held by scholars.</p>

<p>Seager’s <i>Schoole of Virtue</i>, although written in Queen
Mary’s reign, refers, no doubt, to a previous state of things.
The author seems to take for granted that attendance at
school is a very common, if not the ordinary thing, and that
it is in the power of most youths to make their future by
study and perseverance.</p>

<p>The writer then warns the boys he is addressing to behave

would do well to walk two and two, and “not in heaps, like a

“Lesson of Wysedom for all maner chyldryn,” urges diligence
and plodding upon his pupils, with a jest as to possible positions
to which the student may in time attain.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to pursue the subject of the education of
the parochial clergy further. After his elementary education
had been received in the schools, the student’s preparation
for the reception of Orders was continued and completed at
the Universities. The ordinary course here was lengthy.
Grammar, which included Latin and literature with rhetoric
and logic, occupied four years. The student was then admitted
a Bachelor. In the case of clerical students this was
followed by seven years’ training before the Bachelor’s degree
in Theology was bestowed, and only after a further three
years’ study of the Bible, and after the candidate had lectured
at least on some one book of the Scriptures, was he considered
to have earned his degree of Doctor in Theology.</p>

<p>The age when the candidate for Orders could be promoted
to the various steps leading to the priesthood was settled by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
law and custom. A boy of seven, if he showed signs of
having a vocation to the sacred ministry, might be made
a cleric by receiving the tonsure. In “rare instances” and
under special circumstances he might then receive an
ecclesiastical benefice, and so get the wherewith to live
while he was studying to fulfil the duties attached to his
office. In the course of the next seven years the youth
could be given the minor Orders of “doorkeeper,” “lector,”
“exorcist,” and “acolyte.” He would then be at least
fourteen years of age, and thus at the time of life at which in
those days students were supposed to begin their University
course. At eighteen the candidate to the priesthood might
be ordained Subdeacon; at twenty he could take the
diaconate, and at twenty-five be ordained Priest. It will be
noticed that these ages in some way generally correspond to
the academic degrees. Going to the University at fourteen,
a clerical student might have, and no doubt frequently
had, received the various steps of minor Orders. Four
years of the liberal arts enabled him at eighteen to take
his degree of Bachelor of Arts. It was at this age that
he could be ordained Subdeacon. Then seven years of
theological study enabled him to become a Bachelor of
Divinity at twenty-five, at which time he was of the right
age to receive the priesthood. This was the regular course;
but without doubt the greater number of candidates for the
ministry did not pass through all the schools. Some, no
doubt, after entering sacred Orders, became attached to
cathedrals, colleges of priests, and even parochial churches,
where, in the midst of a more or less active life, they prepared
themselves for further ecclesiastical advancement. Wherever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
they were, however, they would have to prove themselves
to be sufficiently lettered and of good life before they would
be accepted for Ordination, and their examination and proof
was put as a conscientious duty upon the bishop before he
determined upon accepting and ordaining them. For a
candidate to become a cleric there was not much difficulty,
if he showed sufficient diligence and good-will, and the
various minor Orders were also bestowed without any serious
question as to the likelihood of failure, etc., in the ecclesiastical
career. With the subdiaconate, however, this was in no
sense the case, and no one was allowed to be ordained without
what was called a “title,” that is, he was required to show
that he had been nominated to a benefice sufficient for his
proper maintenance, or had been given a responsible
guarantee of adequate support for one in sacred Orders. In
the case of sons of well-to-do parents the bishop might accept
the possession of sufficient property as guarantee under the
title of “patrimony.” Moreover, the Episcopal Registers
show for what large numbers of clergy the religious houses
became surety for a fitting maintenance in the event of
failure of health or withdrawal of ecclesiastical resources. A
certificate of Orders received was to be furnished by the
bishop’s official, the fee for each of which was settled in the
English Church by Archbishop Stratford at 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The entry into the clerical state, with its duties and
privileges, was outwardly manifested by the tonsure and
<i>corona</i>. The former, as the gloss upon the Constitution of
Cardinal Otho declares, was the shaving of a circle on the
crown of the cleric as a sign of the laying aside all desire for
temporal advantages and avaricious thoughts. “And,” says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
the author, “in the proper tonsure of clerics, I believe, is included
the shaving of beards, which, contrary to the law, many
modern clerks grow with great care.” The <i>corona</i>, although
apparently in time it became synonymous with the “tonsure,”
in its original English meaning certainly signified the close
crop of the hair, on the upper part of the head, as “a sign
that clerics sought only the Kingdom of God.” One curious
instance of a bishop giving the tonsure in a parish church
may be mentioned. In 1336, Bishop Grandisson, of Exeter,
went to St. Buryan to terminate a serious quarrel between
the inhabitants and himself, in which they had practically
rejected his jurisdiction. He was attended by many of the
gentry and the clergy, one of whom translated the bishop’s
address into Cornish, for those who only understood that
language. The parish then renewed their obedience “in
English, French, and Cornish,” and the bishop absolved them
from the penalties of their disobedience. After which, says
the record, “he gave the first tonsure, or sign of the clerical
character, to many who were natives of that parish.”</p>

<p>The dress of clerics was legislated for by the Constitutions
of Cardinal Ottoboni, to which subsequent reference was
constantly made by the English bishops. Thus the same
Bishop Grandisson, in 1342, issued a monition to his clergy
on the subject, in which he speaks of the sensible legislation
of the cardinal. All clerics were directed to follow this law
as to their dress; it was not to be so long or so short as to
be an object of ridicule or remark. The cassock or clerical
coat in length was to be well above the ankles (<i>ultra tibiarum
medium attingentes</i>), and the hair was to be cut so that it
could not be parted and showed the ears plainly. In this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
way, by their <i>corona</i> and tonsure, and by the exterior form
of their dress, they might be clearly known and distinguished
from laymen. Cardinal Otho likewise enforced the regulation
about clerical dress, and declared that some of the English
clergy looked rather like soldiers than priests, an opinion
which the author of the gloss endorsed with the saying that
it is not only in their dress that some offend, but in their
open-mouthed laugh (<i>risus dentium</i>) and their general gait.
The cardinal directs that all clerics shall use their outer dress
closed, and not open like a cloak, and this in particular in
churches, in meetings of the clergy, and by all parish priests,
always and everywhere in their parishes.</p>

<p>The status of the English clergy, generally from a legal
standpoint, is thus described in Pollock and Maitland’s
<i>History of English Law</i>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Taken individually, every ordained clerk has as such a peculiar
legal status; he is subject to special rules of ecclesiastical law and
to special rules of temporal law.... Every layman, unless he
were a Jew, was subject to ecclesiastical law; it regulated many
affairs of his life, marriages, divorces, testaments, intestate succession;
it would try him and punish him for various offences, for adultery,
fornication, defamation; it would constrain him to pay tithes and
other similar dues; in the last resort it could excommunicate him,
and then the State would come to its aid.... The ordained clerk
was within many rules of ecclesiastical law which did not affect the
layman, and it had a tighter hold over him, since it could suspend
him from office, deprive him of benefice, and degrade him from his
Orders.”</p>
</div>

<p>So much about the clergy generally and about the way
in which they entered the clerical state and mounted the
various steps of the minor and sacred Orders, until their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
reception of the sacred priesthood brought them into the close
relations which existed between the clergyman and his flock.
It is now time to turn to the consideration of the various
kinds of parochial clergy. And first (1) The <i>Rector</i> or
<i>Parson</i> was appointed to his benefice by the patron of the
living, with the approval of the bishop, by whose order he
was also inducted or instituted. Among the <i>Harleian
Charters</i> in the British Museum is an original deed of induction
to a living, which sets out the ceremony and prescribes
the feast to follow. The benefice after his induction
became the rector’s freehold. In the language of Bracton,
the position of a rector differed legally from that of a vicar,
inasmuch as he could sue and be sued for the property or
benefice he held, which he did in the name of the Church.
And to this “only rectors of parochial churches are entitled,
who have been instituted as parsons by bishops and by
ordinaries.” It was the duty of the archdeacon, either personally
or by his official, on the certificate of the bishop, to
put the rector into possession of his benefice. The fee to be
paid, according to the Constitution of Archbishop Stratford,
was not to exceed 40<i>d.</i> when the archdeacon came in person,
“which sum is sufficient for the expenses of four persons
and their horses;” or two shillings when the official came with
two or three horses.</p>

<p>Previously to this, however, and before issuing his letters
of induction, the bishop was bound to satisfy himself that the
priest presented to fill the rectory had the necessary qualities
of a good pastor of souls. In the Constitution of Cardinal
Otho on this point, after recalling the saying of St. Gregory
that “the guidance of souls is the art of arts,” the cardinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
goes on to say that “our Catholic art” requires that there
“should be one priest in one church,” and that he should
be a fitting teacher, “by his holy life, his learning, and his
teaching,” and upon this last quality Lyndwood notes that
he should be able to adapt his instructions to his audience.
“Whilst to the wise and learned he may speak of high and
profound things, to the simple and those of lesser mental
capacity he should preach plainly about few things, and
those that are useful.” As to these qualifications the bishop
had to satisfy himself within two months after the presentation,
in order that the parish should not be kept vacant
longer than was necessary. Besides the above-named
qualities, by ordinary law of the English Church, any one
presented as a rector was bound to be a cleric; to be at least
five and twenty years old; to be commendable in his life and
knowledge; and if not a priest, he was at least to be fit to
receive the priesthood within a year. As a rule each rectory,
or benefice for a rector, had but a single rector; but there
are instances where in one place, at Leverton, for example,
there were two parsons appointed to one church, with two
houses, with the tithes divided, and, of course, with the
obligations distinct. In a few cases, as at Darley Dale,
Derbyshire, there were three or even more rectors for the one
parish.</p>

<p>In the first chapter it has been pointed out what were
the tithes payable to the rector of a parish, and that they
frequently brought in a considerable sum of money. On the
other hand, there were many and constant claims made upon
the revenues of the parochial church, and this not accidentally
or casually, but by custom and almost by law. The repair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
of the chancel and the upkeep of choir-books and other
things necessary for the services, which were not found by
the people, had to be met out of the “fourth part” of the
tithe, which was supposed to be devoted to such purposes.
Another constant claim was the relief of the poor, strangers,
and wayfarers, called “hospitality.” This, according to Lyndwood,
was well understood and practised in England, where
the churches, to meet those calls, were better endowed than
they were abroad.</p>

<p>This claim, there can be no doubt, was fully accepted and
carried out. If a rector was for some reason or other non-resident,
by law his charity or “hospitality” had to be
administered either by the curate who served the church, or
by a resident proctor appointed for the purpose. In acknowledgment
of this obligation, in the wills of the period we find
the clergy directing money to be paid by their executors to
the poor of the parishes which they had served. Thus
William Sheffield, Dean of York, who died in 1496, after
arranging that this distribution should be made in proportion
to the time during which he had held each benefice, adds:
“For the goods of the Church are the property of the poor
and therefore the conscience is heavily burdened in the
spending of the goods of the Church. For badly spending
them Jesus have mercy.”</p>

<p>In the record of the visitation of churches in the
diocese of Exeter, in 1440, there are many references to
the “hospitality” kept by the clergy. In one instance the
rector is praised for having rebuilt his chancel and added
two good rooms to the rectory, one for himself and one for
the purposes of hospitality. In another there is a note “that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
from time immemorial to the day of the present rector,
great hospitality had been maintained, and the goods of the
church had been made the property of the sick and the
poor,” but that this had ceased. It seems to us, indeed,
almost strange in these days to see what was the teaching
of the mediæval Church about the claims of the poor, and to
remember that this was not the doctrine of some rhetorical
and irresponsible preacher, but of such a man of law and
order as was the great Canonist Lyndwood. There can be
no doubt that the proceeds of ecclesiastical benefices were
recognised in the Constitutions of legates and archbishops as
being in fact, as well as in theory, the <i>eleemosynæ</i>, the <i>spes
pauperum</i>—the alms and the hope of the poor. Those
ecclesiastics who consumed the revenues of their cures on
other than necessary and fitting purposes were declared to
be “defrauders of the rights of God’s poor,” and “thieves of
Christian alms intended for them;” whilst the English
canonists and legal professors, who glossed these provisions
of the Church law, gravely discussed the ways in which the
poor of a parish could vindicate their right—<i>right</i>, they call
it—to a share in the ecclesiastical revenues of their Church.</p>

<p>This “jus pauperum,” which is set forth in such a textbook
of English law as Lyndwood’s <i>Provinciale</i>, is naturally
put forth more clearly and forcibly in a work intended for
popular instruction, such as <i>Dives et Pauper</i>. “To them
that have the benefices and goods of Holy Church,” writes
the author, “it belonged principally to give alms and to
have the cure of poor people.” To him who squanders the
alms of the altar on luxury and useless show the poor man
may justly point and say, “It is ours that you so spend in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
pomp and vanity!... That thou keepest for thyself of the
altar passing the honest needful living, it is raveny, it is
theft, it is sacrilege.” From the earliest days of English
Christianity the care of the helpless poor was regarded as
an obligation incumbent on all; and in 1342 Archbishop
Stratford, dealing with <i>appropriations</i>, or the assignment of
ecclesiastical revenue to the support of some religious house
or college, ordered that a portion of the tithe should always
be set apart for the relief of the poor, because, as Bishop
Stubbs has pointed out, in England, from the days of King
Ethelred, “a third part of the tithe” which belonged to the
Church was the acknowledged birthright of the poorer
members of Christ’s flock. All the old diocesan registers of
English sees afford like instances of specific injunctions as to
bestowing part of the income of the benefice on the poor
when appropriations were granted.</p>

<p>Besides the regular revenues from parochial tithes, the
rector had other sources of income. Such, for instance, were
the offerings made for various services rendered to individuals,
as baptisms, marriages, churching of women, and
funerals. An offering, also, for a special Mass said or sung
for a particular person or intention, was made to the rector
if he officiated, which by the Constitution of Lambeth he
could only do when the special service did not interfere with
the regular duties of his cure. In 1259-60 Bishop Bronescombe
settled the Mass fee at “one penny;” and in the
churchwardens’ accounts of Dover there is an entry, in 1536,
of a payment “for ten Masses with their offeryng pens,
which was for Grace’s obit,” 4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> In law these offerings
were known as “memorial pence” (<i>denarii memoriales</i>), or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
“earnest pence” (<i>denarii perquisiti</i>), because, on account of
this “retaining fee,” the priest engaged to offer Mass on a
special day.</p>

<p>Various “oblations,” moreover, were apparently made to
the parson regularly. At Folkestone, for example, according
to the <i>Valor Ecclesiasticus</i>, an oblation of 5<i>d.</i> was made to
the priest each Sunday. Lyndwood lays down, as the law
regarding regular oblations “made on Sundays and Festivals,
etc.,” that they belong to the priest who had the cure of
souls, “whose duty it was to pray for the sins of the people.”
Other priests, who might be attached to the church, had no
claims upon them except by agreement, as those who make
the offering are not their parishioners. Oblations of this
kind were not always voluntary, and they could be recovered
for the clergyman by the bishop, as, for instance, when they
were made according to a previous agreement, or promise,
or in any special need of the Church, as when the minister
had not sufficient to support himself properly; or when such
offering was made according to established custom.</p>

<p>Bishop Quevil, in the Synod of Exeter, states what were
the long-established customs in the English Church as to
regular oblations. Every adult parishioner above the age
of fourteen years had to make an offering four times a year,
at Christmas and Easter, on the patronal feast, and on the
dedication feast of his parish church, or, according to custom,
on All Saints’ day. The bishop also desired that the people
of his diocese should be persuaded to bring Pentecost offerings
also to their parish churches, or at least to send them to
their parsons. To induce them so to do, special indulgences
granted to all benefactors of churches were to be published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
on each of the three Sundays before the feast, and all such
offerings were to be taken to the place where the Whit-Sunday
processions assemble. Bishop Rigaud de Asserio,
of Winchester, in 1321, makes the same claim as to the
regular four payments, but puts the age at eighteen, and
even then only claims the oblation as a right in the case
of those possessing some movables of their own. In some
instances, apparently, a portion of the offerings made for any
special object was by custom given to the priest for his own
use, as a well-understood tax. This, for example, was the
case at St. Augustine’s church at Hedon, in the East Riding
of Yorkshire, where in the fifteenth century “a third of the
oblations to the Holy Cross was given to the Vicar.”</p>

<p>The rectory house, which was situated near to the church,
would no doubt in these days be considered very poor. A
living-room and a bedroom, with perhaps a room in which
to exercise “hospitality,” with some necessary offices and a
kitchen, were all that, as far as can be ascertained, constituted
the dwelling-place of the parochial priest. “Religious
feelings,” says Dr. Rock, “sweetened the homeliness of everyday
life.” Over the parlour chimneypiece in the vicarage
house at Besthorpe, Norfolk, built by Sir Thomas Downyng,
priest, are these lines—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All you that sitt by thys fire warmyng</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pray for the sowle of Sir Jhon Downyng.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Probably, in some place attached to the rectory there would
have been some kind of enclosure, or priest’s garden. Occasionally,
mention is made of the existence of one, as, for
instance, in the visitation of churches of the archdeaconry
of Norwich, in 1363, where in one case the rector is said to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
have in his use a house and garden “next to the rectory on
the north side.” But this seems to have been really parish
property, as it is recorded that it “was sufficient to find all
the candles in the church.” Sometimes, no doubt, the
priests’ houses would have been larger than they usually
appear to have been from the examples that survive or the
records which are available. Thus in the early fifteenth
century the Bishop of Lincoln granted a priest in his diocese
permission to have a private oratory in his rectory house,
on condition that the oratory was fittingly adorned, and
that no other rite but Mass was celebrated in it. The Holy
Sacrifice might be offered there either by him or any other
priest in his presence.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>A curious example of a poor rector being received as a
boarder into a religious house is recorded in the register of
Bishop Stapledon. The parish of Charles, in Devonshire,
was, in 1317, found to be burdened with great debt, and its
state evidently almost bankrupt. With the consent of the
bishop, the rector, Walter de Wolfe, called upon the Prior
of Pilton to help him out of his difficulties. It was consequently
agreed that the best way was for the rector to come
and live in the priory, and for the prior to farm the revenues
of the parish for five years, during which time he should serve
it, and with the savings pay off the debts of the rector.</p>

<p>The <i>Vicar</i> in many ways had the same work and
responsibility as a rector in regard to all parochial duties.
He was legally, however, as the word implies, one who took
the place, or was the deputy of the rector. Although a
rector, actually in possession of a parish and engaged in
working it, could with permission and for adequate reasons
appoint a vicar as <i>locum tenens</i>, in England almost universally
by a “vicar” was meant the priest appointed to work a
parish in the case of an impropriated living. The nature
of these benefices has already been explained, and it is
unnecessary here to do more than recall the fact, that
although the greater tithes went to the monastery, college,
or dignity to which the living had been impropriated, the
appointed vicar had his portion of tithe, the oblations made
to the church he served, and a pension settled by the episcopal
authority. These, at any rate, with the rest of the
income, afforded adequate support, with, in addition, sufficient
to enable him to do the repairs of the chancel, which, in
the case of the rectorial benefice, were incumbent on the parson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>This position of vicars only requires to be illustrated here
very briefly. In 1322, Bishop Rigaud de Asserio, of Winchester,
settled the means of support and the duties of the
Vicar of Romsey, as between him and the abbess and convent.
Every day the vicar was to have from the abbey two
corrodies equal to what two nuns had. He was to take the
tithes on flax, on hemp, and on fifteen other products of the
soil; he was to have all funeral dues, and all legacies of dead
people, except those specifically left for the repair, etc., of
chancel; he was also to have certain lands to work for his
own purposes, and to take all oblations made in the church.
On the other hand, besides his ordinary duties, he was to
pay all ecclesiastical dues and taxes; to find all books and
ornaments of the church, and to repair and maintain them, as
well also as to keep up and repair the entire chancel of the
church. To take another case: the monks of Glastonbury,
the impropriators of the parish of Doulting, in Somerset,
received &#163;18 a year in the sixteenth century from their
portion of the impropriated tithe. Their vicar at the same
time, with the duty of looking after the annexed chapels,
took &#163;43.</p>

<p>The mode of institution for a vicar was very much that of
a rector. He was appointed by the impropriator of the
living, acting as patron, and he had to receive the assent of
the bishop of the diocese. By a statute of Cardinal Otho,
confirming the practice of the English Church, “no one could
be appointed to a vicarage unless he were a priest, or a
deacon ready to be ordained a priest at the next <i>Quatuor
temporum</i> ordination.” On his appointment, he had to
surrender every other ecclesiastical benefice, and to take an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
oath that he would reside continually in his vicarage, so that
any absence beyond the space of three weeks was unlawful.</p>

<p>The above legislation, of course, regarded only what
were known as <i>perpetual vicars</i>—those, namely, that were
appointed to impropriated livings with a tenure of office
similar to that of rectors. The author of the gloss on the Constitution
of Otho notes that in England there were really four
kinds of vicars, or four classes of priests who were accounted
or known as vicars: (1) those who for a stipend took the
cures of rectors, or of perpetual vicars, temporarily, and at the
will of those who engaged them—these did not require the
licence of the bishop, unless under special diocesan law;
(2) those sent by the Pope, etc., to certain parts of the world
were called vicars; (3) vicars appointed by the bishops, and
known as <i>vicars-general</i>; and (4) the <i>perpetual vicars</i> of
churches, instituted to the cure of souls by the bishop, and by
his licence installed—these were most properly called vicars.</p>

<p>It is evident, from what is set out in the <i>Valor Ecclesiasticus</i>,
that the vicar proper, if he found it necessary, had to
provide help in the way of a curate. In this there was no
distinction between a rector and a vicar; and it is obvious
that, where this was required, provision for it had been made
in the arrangement which had been come to in the first
instance between the impropriators and the bishop; or that
arrangement had subsequently been modified to enable the
vicar to meet the expense of extra help.</p>

<p><i>Curates.</i>—Next in importance among the parochial
clergy come the assistant priests, known as <i>Curates</i> (<i>curati</i>),
or those entrusted with the cure of souls. They are called
in canon law <i>vice curati</i>, or <i>capellani</i>, who “administer the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
sacraments, not in their own name, but in the name of
another”—that is, in the name of the rector or perpetual
vicar. They were also, as previously pointed out, in England
occasionally called vicars, in the sense of taking the place of
the rector, etc.</p>

<p>Every curate by law was to receive from the rector or
vicar who employed him a fixed and sufficient salary, and all
manner of bargains as to payment or contracting out of
obligations were prohibited. Thus in the acts of the Synod
of Ely, in 1364, Bishop Simon Langham says, “We strictly
prohibit any rector from making a bargain with his (assistant)
priest of this kind: that besides his fixed stipend he may take
offerings for anniversary Masses, etc., since such a bargain is a
clear indication that the fixed stipend is too small”—and to
make it up, these fees are looked for, and the parish Masses
may be neglected. In fact, by the Constitution of Archbishop
Courtney, in 1391, the curates were to receive none of the
oblations, fees, or offerings made in a parish, for services for
which they received a sufficient payment from those who
employed them.</p>

<p>According to the same Constitution, the curate was
admitted to his office by the rector or vicar on any Sunday
or Feast-day before the parishioners at the parochial mass.
After the Gospel of the Mass the curate took an oath to
respect the above conditions as to fees, etc., in the parish
church or any chapel of ease in which he celebrated Mass,
and declared that he would neither stir up nor take part in
any quarrel or misunderstanding between the rector and his
people; but that, on the contrary, he would ever strive to
preserve both peace and love between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>A curate thus instituted could only hear the confessions
of parishioners in the church or chapel where he said Mass
according to the leave and permission he had received; he was
bound to be present in the choir of the parish church, vested
in a surplice, at Matins, High Mass, Vespers, and other Divine
service at the appointed hours on Sundays and festivals,
together with the other ministers of the church, who were
legally bound to assist at and increase the numbers of those
present at these services, and not to remain in the nave or
walk about in the cemetery, etc. On Sundays and Feast-days,
when a funeral Mass had to be said, the curate, unless
with leave of his rector, was not allowed to begin this
Mass until after the Gospel of the High Mass. In their
private lives curates were warned always to act as priests,
and not to frequent taverns, plays, or illicit spectacles. In
dress and carriage they were ever to uphold the credit of the
ecclesiastical state, and not to bring scandal upon their
rectors or upon themselves.</p>

<p>Sometimes the need of extra assistance in the parish was
felt by the people, and very frequently they contributed the
sum necessary for a curate’s sufficient stipend. At times the
people even appealed to the bishop to force the parson to
seek additional help. Thus in the diocese of London, in
the fourteenth century, there is recorded the complaints of the
inhabitants of a parish that their vicar would not allow the
services of a priest for whom they had paid, and that thus
“they were deprived of daily Mass, and other divine service,
with the sacraments and sacramentals.”</p>

<p>At times, indeed, the need of an assistant in a parish was
so obvious that the bishop felt bound to interfere in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
secure the appointment. Thus Bishop Rigaud de Asserio, of
Winchester, in 1323, appointed a curate to the Vicar of
Twyford, “who was suffering from an incurable disease” and
unable to do the work of his parish. In the same way, in
1313-14, Bishop Stapledon, of Exeter, appointed a curate
coadjutor to the Vicar of St. Neots, who was found to be
suffering from leprosy. The vicar was to have a certain
stipend; was to keep the best room in the parsonage, with the
adjoining parts of the house, except the hall. The door
between this room and the vicar’s chamber was to be built up,
and the newly appointed curate was to have the whole
administration of the vicarage.</p>

<p>The <i>Chantry Priest</i>.—Next in order of importance among
the priests of a mediæval parish come the clergymen serving
any chantry attached to the church. These chantry chapels
were, as is well known, very numerous in pre-Reformation
days, particularly in towns; but it has hitherto not been sufficiently
recognised that the priests serving them in any way
helped in parochial work. This is simply because the purpose,
for which those adjuncts to parish churches existed, has not
been understood. We have been taught to believe that a
“chantry” only meant a place (chapel or other locality)
where Masses were offered for the repose of the soul of the
donor, and other specified benefactors. No doubt there were
such chantries existing, but to imagine that they were even
the rule is wholly to mistake the purpose of such foundations.
Speaking broadly, the chantry priest was an assistant priest
of the parish, or, as we should nowadays say, curate of the
parish, who was supported by the foundation fund of the
benefactors for that purpose, and indeed not unfrequently even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
by the contributions of the inhabitants. For the most part
their <i>raison d’être</i> was to look after the poor of the parish, to
visit the sick, and to assist in the functions of the parish
church. Moreover, connected with these chantries were very
commonly what were called “obits.” These were not, as we
have been asked to believe, mere money payments to the
priest for some anniversary services; but they were for the
most part money left quite as much for annual alms to
the poor, as for the celebration of any anniversary offices.
Let us take a few examples. In the city of Nottingham
there were two chantries connected with the parish church
of St. Mary’s, that of Our Lady, and that called Amyas
Chantry. The former, we are told, was founded “to maintain
the services and to be an aid to the vicar, and partly to
succour the poor;” the latter for the priest to assist in “God’s
service,” and to pray for William Amyas, the founder. When
the commissioners in the first year of Edward VI. came to
inquire into the possessions of these chantries, they were
asked by the people of the place to note that in this
parish there were “1400 houseling people, and that the
vicar there had no other priest to help but the above two
chantry priests.” It is not necessary to say that these foundations
were not spared on this account; for within two years
the property, upon which these two priests were supported,
had been sold to two speculators in suchlike parcels of land—John
Howe and John Broxholme.</p>

<p>Then, again, in the parish of St. Nicholas, at Nottingham,
we find from the returns of the Commissioners that the
members of the “Guild of the Virgin” contributed to the
support of an extra priest. In the parish there were “more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
than 200 houseling people,” and as the parish living was
very poor, there was no other priest to look after them
but this one, John Chester, who was paid by the Guild.
The King’s officials, however, did not hesitate on this account
to confiscate the property. It is useless to multiply instances
of this kind, some hundreds of which might be given in the
county of Nottingham alone. It may be interesting, however,
to take one or two examples of “obits” in this part
of England. In the parish of South Wheatley there were
parish lands let out to farm, which produced 18<i>d.</i> a year;
say from &#163;1 to &#163;1 4<i>s.</i> of our money. Of this sum, 1<i>s.</i>
was for the poor and 6<i>d.</i> for church lights; that is, two-thirds,
or, say, 16<i>s.</i> of our money, was for the relief of the
distressed. So in the parish of Tuxford the church “obit”
lands produced &#163;1 5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, or more than &#163;16 a year; of this
16<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> was intended for the poor, and 9<i>s.</i> for the church
expenses. It is almost unnecessary to add that the Crown
took the whole sum; that intended for the poor, as well
as that used for the support of the ecclesiastical services.
Neither can it be held, I fear, that the robbery of the poor
was accidental and unpremeditated. It has been frequently
asserted, of course, that although grave injury was undoubtedly
done to the poor and needy in this way, it was altogether
inevitable, since the money thus intended for them was
so inextricably bound up with property to which religious
obligations (now declared to be superstitious and illegal)
were attached, that the whole passed together into the
royal exchequer. It would be well if it could be shown
that this spoliation of the sick and needy by the Crown
of England was accidental and unpremeditated; but there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
are the hard facts which cannot be got over. The documents
prove unmistakably that the attention of the officials was
drawn to the claims of the poor, and that in every such
case these claims were disregarded, and a plain intimation
was given that the Crown deliberately intended to take
even the pittance of the poor.</p>

<p>The <i>Stipendiary</i> priest differed in little from the curate,
except that he was engaged and paid for some special service
and not for the general purposes of a parish like a curate.
They (<i>i.e.</i> the stipendiaries) live, says Lyndwood, upon the
stipend paid them for their service, and have no fixed title
or claim upon the church where they offer up their Mass, except
that they are paid for doing so for a year or other fixed
time. They had no claim whatever to fees or oblations, and
indeed, they were prohibited from receiving them.</p>

<p>Like all other priests dwelling within the bounds of a
parish, Stipendiaries were bound to attend in the choir of
the parochial church in surplice at Matins, High Mass,
Vespers, and at all other public Divine service. They were
to be ready to read the lessons, sing in the psalms and
other chants, or take any other part, according to the
disposition of the rector or vicar. Some entries in the
Chantry certificates show that this duty was understood
and fulfilled to the end. At Costessy, in Norfolk, to take
but one example, a stipendiary priest was paid &#163;6 by
King’s College, Cambridge, to offer Mass in a Free chapel,
for the convenience of the people at a distance, and the
certificate adds, “and the said priest hath always used
to help the curate sing divine service upon holy day in
the parish church.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p><i>Chaplain</i> was a name given apparently to two sets of
priests. The priest employed, by a nobleman or other
person of distinction, to say Mass in a private chapel, and
the priest who served a chapel of ease, established for
the convenience of the people in a much extended parish,
were both designated chaplains. Of the first, it is only
necessary to say, that so far at the parish was concerned,
it could claim the presence and help of even all private
chaplains at the ordinary services of the church.</p>

<p>The public chaplains, or those who served in chapels
of ease, were of greater importance in parochial work. The
necessity for these chapelries appears clearly in the “Chantry
certificates,” under colour of the act for suppressing which
most of the chapels were destroyed. Thus to take a few
examples: The “Free chapel” of Tylne, in the parish of
Hayton, in Cumberland, had been founded by a priest
named Robert Poore. It had “always been accustomed
to have all manner of Sacraments ministered by the chaplain
there to the inhabitants of North and South Tylne. By
reason that many times in the year such influence of waters
and snow doth abound so much within the said hamlets,
the inhabitants thereof can by no means resort unto their
parish church of Hayton, being two miles distant from the
said chapel, neither for christening, burying, or other rites.”
And again at South Leverton, in Nottinghamshire, there
was a “chapel of Cottam, a mile distant from the parish
church,” at which eighty people received the Sacraments.
And, adds the “certificate,” “many times the waters being
up the people cannot come to their parish church.”</p>

<p>Such chapels were built at the cost of the people of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
the parish, and under careful restrictions and conditions laid
down by the bishop of the diocese. An excellent instance
of this is to be found in the register of Bishop Brantyngham,
of Exeter, where it is recorded that in 1372 he dedicated
a chapel of ease at Dartmouth. Up to this time Dartmouth
was in the parish of Townstall, which was a vicarage, the
benefice being appropriated to the Premonstratensian Abbey
of Torre. The people living at Dartmouth, failing to obtain
permission to have a chapel, proceeded to build one without
leave of the abbey or of their vicar. After considerable
difficulty, and upon the intervention of the bishop, it was
allowed that the people on the seashore, many of them
old and infirm and women, frequently were unable to get
to their parish church, especially in stormy winter weather.
For this reason the erection of the chapel with a baptistery
and cemetery was finally allowed, and they were permitted
to find a chaplain to serve it, who was to be licensed from
year to year, and admitted by the Vicar of Townstall.
In the same way Bishop Stafford allowed the establishment
of a chapel at Kingsbridge, in Devon, in 1414. The people
who used the chapel had to maintain it, and even the
chancel, as well as all the necessary books and ornaments.
They were not charged, however, with the payment of their
own chaplain, or with the provision of bread and wine for
the Blessed Eucharist, which fell upon the rector of the
parish of Churston. Burials of the dead had up to this time
taken place at the mother church; but this, in view of circumstances
adduced, the bishop thought unreasonable. On
the Feast of the Dedication of the parish church, however,
every adult was bound to attend there at the service and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
to make an offering. Certain other dues also were ordered
to be paid in acknowledgment of the ties of the chapel to
the mother church.</p>

<p>At one place, a chaplain was employed by the rector to
say Mass for the convenience of the people in a chapel
attached to a house some distance from the parish church.
In another chapel of ease, a parishioner left money for a
foundation of three Masses weekly for the people; and at
Tatton, near Bristol, the churchwardens, in 1506, were paying
“Sir Richard York, chapel priest,” 27<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a quarter for
his services.</p>

<p>Besides the above-named priests, all more or less connected
with the working of a mediæval parish, it was ordered that,
wherever the means of the place would allow it, there should
be always a deacon and subdeacon to assist in the due
celebration of the Divine service. Chance references in
accounts and other documents seem to show that they were
often so employed. In one set of churchwardens’ accounts
there is a curious entry of receipt from a deacon, who pays
for damage done to certain vestments at the time of his
ordination. In another, a collection was made from the
parishioners for the support of the deacon; and in a book
of directions for clerics, it is laid down as part of the deacon’s
office to bring the pyx containing the Blessed Sacrament from
behind the altar, where it had been hanging, and to place it
on the table of the altar for the priest to communicate the
faithful.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE PARISH OFFICIALS</p>


<p>If the parish priest, rector, or vicar was undoubtedly the
admitted centre of life in the district, the father of his
people and the pastor of his flock, neither on his part
nor on that of the parishioners was there any mistake about
the rights and duties of the people to the parish church and
towards parish matters generally. Within well-defined limits,
the parish, which included both parson and people, managed
its own affairs. Every adult of both sexes had a voice in
this self-government, and, as Bishop Hobhouse has pointed
out, in pre-Reformation days a wise freedom in the management
of the fabric of the church and its accessories seemed
to have been left to the parish by the diocesan authorities.
They—the people—encouraged by every means in their
power, and indeed frequently initiated, those manifestations
of zeal for beautifying God’s house which form so remarkable
a feature in the architectural history of the fifteenth and
early sixteenth centuries. Moreover, it is impossible to turn
over the church accounts of that period which have come
down to us, without acknowledging that the love of the
people for their parish churches was supported and intensified
by the feeling that it was their work, and that upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
each of them in conscience lay the duty of assisting to maintain
the sanctuary, where, according to their strong and
simple faith, God dwelt in their midst, and of helping to
keep up within this holy place the round of prayers and praise
and sacrifice.</p>

<p>This common purpose of all within a parish was in those
days not left to be carried out by chance or by mere individual
effort; it was highly and intelligently organised to
secure the co-operation and the continual contributions
necessary for successfully carrying out the work. For this
end certain officials were chosen by popular election as the
people’s representatives, others were appointed in various ways
and others, again, were employed as their services were
required.</p>

<p><i>The Churchwardens.</i>—The representatives of the people
in all parochial work were their wardens, or the churchwardens,
as they are generally called. Pollock and Maitland, in their
<i>History of English Law</i>, do not think that there were real
churchwardens before the thirteenth century. Previously,
however, it is admitted that certain burdens as to the support
of the church had been placed upon the parishioners as
a body. “In the thirteenth century,” for example, “the
general custom of the Church of England, swerving in this
from the <i>jus commune</i> of the Catholic Church, cast the burden
of repairing the nave of the parish church, and providing the
main part of the ecclesiastical apparatus, not upon the parson,
but upon the parishioners.” Whether this burden implied
any corporate organisation of the parishioners or any parish
meeting seems doubtful. But “no doubt the occasional nature
of the charge almost compels the rector or the archdeacon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
to deal with the parishioners as a body, to call them together,
and endeavour to persuade them that a wall is crumbling or
a new missal is wanting.”</p>

<p>Still, whatever their origin, the churchwardens are already
in existence in the thirteenth century; they are then dealt
with as the legal representatives of the parishioners, and they
“present themselves as claimants for property and possession.”
To the authors of the <i>History of English Law</i> their
existence is due to the natural outcome of the responsibility
placed upon the people. “If the parishioners are
compelled to provide precious books, robes, vessels, etc.,
they will naturally desire to have their say about the custody
of these articles; parsons have been known to sell the church
plate.”</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century the churchwardens were chosen
annually in a parish meeting at which, no doubt, the rector
or vicar would have presided; all adult members of the parish
having a voice in the election. At this meeting the outgoing
wardens would give an account of their stewardship, and hand
over the custody of the common funds and common property
to their successors. At the church of St. Mary the Great,
Cambridge, for instance, a special parish meeting was held in
the church, “at the altar of the doom in the south aisle,” for
the settlement of an account “between Thomas Curle, plumber,
on the one part, and the parishioners.” But this was quite
out of the ordinary, and as a rule, once the guardians or
wardens were elected, all the parish business was transacted
by them. In this same church the wardens were chosen,
apparently, on Easter Monday, and the method of election
was somewhat curious. The outgoing churchwardens first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
each nominated one parishioner, who conjointly chose eight
persons to elect the officers of the coming year. In this case
at Cambridge, besides the two churchwardens, there were at
the same time elected for the parish two wardens of the lights
at the Sepulchre and Crucifix; two guardians of the Jesus
Mass; two parish auditors; and “two custodians of the keys
of the chest, called the chantry hutch, in which are all the
charters and deeds relating to the Chantry.”</p>

<p>The number of churchwardens was, apparently by the
fifteenth century, fixed to two, although for special purposes,
as in the above instance, other wardens were appointed. In
the accounts of St. Edmund and St. Thomas at Salisbury,
there were at first three <i>supervisores fabricæ</i>; in 1486 two
“gardiani ecclesiæ” were charged with beginning the reparation
of the church at Easter, “and not to wait till winter.”
With these were two junior wardens, “custodians of the
goods and ornaments of the church.” Apparently, in times
when considerable work was going on, one or more additional
wardens were appointed to give advice and share responsibility;
and once, at least, in the time of some great repairs
to the fabric, the parish meeting stood adjourned from
Friday to Friday until the works were finished. In 1510
two wardens were appointed, and it is curious to note that
one held the purse, and the other, who did not, became his
surety. At St. Mary-at-Hill, in London, the name for the
official churchwardens was, apparently, the “Wardeyns of
the godes, rents, and werks;” or, the “Wardens of the godes,
ornaments, werkes, livelihood, and rents, etc.”</p>

<p>Although the wardens were usually chosen from the men
of a parish, there are examples to show that this need not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
necessarily be the case. Thus the accounts of St. Petrock’s,
Exeter, show that in 1428 a woman, named Beatrice Braye,
was people’s warden; and in the same way, in 1496-7,
“Dame Isabel Norton” held the office at Yatton, in Somerset.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_106fp.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">HOUSELING CLOTH FOR HOLY COMMUNION</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Bishop Hobhouse, in his interesting volume of <i>Churchwardens’
Accounts</i>, has well summed up the duties and
functions of these parish wardens, which were very varied.
They might have both farming and trading to do in fulfilment
of their office, as well as disposing of various gifts
which were made by the parishioners in kind. They also
might have the unpleasant duty of presenting parishioners
to the archdeacon’s court for moral delinquencies. Besides
this, if there was building or decorating to be done in the
church or on buildings belonging to the parish, such as their
common house, the wardens had to find the ways and means,
and to supervise the work. They had to attend at Visitations,
and if the church or the cemetery or a new chalice, etc.,
had to be consecrated, they had to arrange with the bishop
and find the necessary fees. They had to see that the money
due to the common purse from all the various sources was
paid, and that, in the event of some extra work or engagement
being undertaken by the parish, some method of
raising the necessary funds was projected and carried out.
At the same time, the wardens had no civil functions to perform
until late in the reign of Henry VIII. In 1349, indeed,
the Statute of Labourers names them, and tries to place
upon them the duty of helping labourers to return to their
homes; but the attempt came to nothing, and in the accounts
printed by Bishop Hobhouse, the earliest entry for anything
not strictly concerned with their parochial office is in 1512-13,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
when the wardens of Yatton “were charged with repairing
the sluices and scouring the Yeo.”</p>

<p>It was frequently no light task that the churchwardens
undertook for their fellow-parishioners, for the parish possessions
were considerable, and comprised all kinds of property—lands,
houses, flocks and herds, cows, and even hives of bees.
These were, what may be termed, the capital of the parish,
which was constantly being added to by the generosity of
generations of pious benefactors. Then, over and besides
the chancel, which was the freehold of the parson, the
body of the church and other buildings, together with the
churchyard and its enclosure, and generally, if not always,
the common church house, were then under the special
and absolute control of the people’s wardens. If the law
forced the people of a parish to find fitting and suitable
ornaments and vestments, it equally gave them the control
of the ecclesiastical furniture, etc., of their church. Their
chosen representatives were the guardians of the jewels and
plate, of the ornaments and hangings, of the vestments and
tapestries, which were regarded, as in very truth they were, as
the property of every soul in the particular village or district
in which the church was situated. It is no exaggeration to
say that the parish church was in Catholic times the care
and business of all. Its welfare was the concern of the
people at large, and it took its natural place in their daily
lives. Was there, say, building to be done, repairs to be
effected, a new peal of bells to be procured, organs to be
mended, new plate to be bought, and the like, it was the
parish as a corporate body that decided the matter, arranged
the details, and provided for the payment. At times, let us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
say when a new vestment was in question, the whole parish
might be called to sit in council at the church house on this
matter of common interest, and discuss the cost, the stuff,
and the make.</p>

<p>The parish wardens had their duties, also, towards their
poorer brethren in the district. In more than one instance
they were guardians of a common chest, out of which temporary
loans could be obtained by needy parishioners to
enable them to tide over pressing difficulties. These loans
were secured by pledges and the additional surety of other
parishioners. No interest, however, was charged for the use
of the money, and in cases where the pledge had to be sold
to recover the original sum, anything over and above was
returned to the borrower. In other ways, too, the poorer
parishioners were assisted by the corporate property of the
parish. The stock managed by the wardens “were,” says
one of the early English reformers, “in some towns (<i>i.e.</i> townships
and villages) six, some eight, and some a dozen kine,
given unto the stock for the relief of the poor, and used in
some such wise that the poor ‘cottingers,’ which could make
any provision for fodder, had the milk for a very small hire;
and then the number of the stock reserved (that is, of course,
the original number being maintained), all manner of vailes
(or profits), besides both the hire of the milk and the prices
of the young veals and old fat wares, was disposed to the
relief of the poor.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>To take one or two specific instances. The churchwardens’
accounts for St. Dunstan’s, Canterbury, show how the funds
required for the repair of the parish church and other parish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
work were obtained. The people of the district were banded
together in brotherhoods; those that were authorised to beg
wore “scutchons,” or badges, and the special fraternity was
called the “schaft.” They received anything that was given
to them, in kind as well as in money; and the record speaks
of malt, barley, wheat, cows, and sheep belonging to the
parish. One Nicholas Reugge left, by will, four cows to be
let at a rent, the proceeds to pay for the “paschal light,”
which the parishioners had to find, and for which they were
to be freed from all further obligation. These cows, valued
at 10<i>s.</i> each, were leased out at 2<i>s.</i> apiece. In 1521 a farmer,
John Richardson, hired from the wardens twenty-five sheep,
and at the same time the people’s representatives accounted
for receipts from lambs, wool, etc. Everything goes to
show, says Mr. Cowper, the sympathetic editor of these
accounts, “what life and activity there was in the little
parish, which never wanted willing men to devote their time
and influence to the management of their own affairs.” The
churchwardens’ accounts generally, it may be added, tell the
same story, and show, as one writer has well said, “the simple-mindedness
of the population, their cheerful contentment,
the general absence of fraud, their religious feelings, and
general goodwill towards each other.”</p>

<p>According to early legislation, the churchwardens had to
present their settlement in writing to a committee of the
parishioners, who were to be appointed by the parsons for
the purpose, and these accounts were to be handed to the
archdeacons at the time of their visitations. Thus Bishop
Quevil, in the Synod of Exeter, in 1287, declares that the
inventories of all that belonged to the church should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
made yearly by the wardens and produced before the rectors,
vicars, or, at any rate, the parish chaplains, and that such
property should on no account be used for other purposes.
Also, that whatever was given for a definite purpose, such as
a light in the church, etc., must not be used for anything
else.</p>

<p>Property, in greater or lesser amounts, houses, lands,
cattle, and rich hangings, etc., were constantly being left by
will, or otherwise given to the churchwardens as trustees
for the parish. The Yarmouth wills of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries contain bequests to particular altars and
lights in St. Nicholas’s Church. Jeffery Wyth, for example,
in 1302 gave 5<i>s.</i> “for maintaining a lamp continually burning
before the great crucifix.” Richard Fastalfe, by his will
made in 1356, gave a tenement to St. Mary’s light in the
same church. In 1490 Thomas Pound directed his executors
“to supply a lamp with oil burning day and night,” and five
wax candles standing “about the lamp before the Most
Holy, or High Altar, to the honour of the Sacrament in
the time of Divine Service, as the said Thomas in his lifetime
had used to do, to continue for ever.” In the same way,
in 1486, Rose Wrytell, a parishioner of St. Mary-at-Hill, left
to the churchwardens, as trustees, certain houses to find the
stipend for a chantry priest, who was to be appointed by the
parishioners, and who was to assist at all the services.</p>

<p>The churchwardens frequently had considerable responsibility
in regard to their office, and if they did not get
more frequently into serious financial difficulties than they
apparently did, it was owing to the cordial way in which the
parish generally supported their endeavours to serve them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
In St. Peter Cheap, in London, the churchwardens held a
good deal of property as trustees. They embarked on “making
and finishing our vestry” in 1475, and the names of those
contributing to the work cover a whole page. We find them
repairing and decorating chantries; employing a priest to
serve; making the priests’ chambers in Cock Alley, where,
apparently, the parson and the chantry priests dwelt in
common; engaging in organ making and paying for a player
and for “the readers of the Passion” on Palm Sunday. The
“Morrow Mass” priest, whose duty it was to say Mass
every day at six o’clock, was paid for by the wardens on
behalf of the parish, as well as a clerk to serve his Mass.</p>

<p>In some documents connected with Exeter diocese in
the fifteenth century, some of the personal difficulties in
which the wardens might be involved are set out. In one
case, where a good deal of repair to the fabric of the church
was necessary, the churchwardens excused themselves on
the plea that the tenants of certain houses belonging to the
parish, upon the rents of which they had relied, had not paid
for some time; in a second case, the excuse made was that
parishioners who had promised help had not given it; in
a third, the parishioners had agreed to a rate to repair the
church and bell-tower, and many had not paid according to
their promises. In every case the bishop, whilst warning
the people to keep their obligations, pointed out that the
“guardians,” or churchwardens, were personally responsible.</p>

<p>Again, there are many examples, in the accounts of the
various parishes, which show that the people considered
the parochial goods held by the churchwardens, even when
they were in the shape of vestments and plate, as their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
property. They exchanged them, lent them, and sold them—always,
of course, for the benefit of the church. In the wardens’
accounts of St. Mary the Great, Cambridge, there are several
examples of this open dealing with church goods. One
instance of this kind of dealing is worth recording. In the
parish of Yatton, Somerset, on the eve of the Reformation—about
1520, say—a difficulty, to which reference has already
been made, arose as to the repair of certain sluices to keep
back the winter floods. To make a long story short—in the
end, the parishioners were ordered to make good the defect.
It meant money; and the wardens’ accounts show that they
had been spending money generously on the church. It was
consequently decided that to raise the necessary cash they
should sell a piece of silver church plate, which had been
purchased some years before by the common contributions
of the faithful. The instance furnishes a supreme example
of the way in which the people of a mediæval parish
regarded the property of God’s house as their own.</p>

<p><i>Parish Clerk, or Holy-water Bearer (Aquæbajularius).</i>—Second
only in importance to the churchwardens was the
<i>parish clerk</i>, or, as he was frequently called from one of
his chief duties, the “water-bearer.” Originally, as the
name “clerk” implies, he was a cleric, and his office was
considered to be a regular ecclesiastical benefice. In the
fourteenth century the clerk was married, but one such was
fined for the offence in a visitation in that century in the
Salisbury diocese. In process of time, however, owing to
the scarcity of clerics, the office was often held by a married
layman.</p>

</figure>

<p>The English law as to this official was laid down in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
the Constitution of Archbishop Boniface of Savoy, in the
thirteenth century. The benefice was, according to this, to
be bestowed “upon poor clerks.” And as there had been
many disputes about the bestowal
of the office, the archbishop decreed
that henceforward “the
rectors and vicars (of parish
churches), who know better than
parishioners those that are fit for
the office, shall institute such
clerics in these benefices as they
know in their hearts can and will
properly serve in the Divine offices
(of the church) and will obey their
directions.” Upon which law
Lyndwood remarks, that it is always the privilege of the
Ecclesiastical Superior to appoint his inferiors in his own
church, and that it is no part of the right of any patron;
which, in this instance, may be taken to include the parishioners,
who were supposed to find the salary. In the manuscript
accounts of the wardens of St. Botulph’s, Aldersgate Street,
a payment of &#163;4 a year was made to the clerk, and this
sum was specially collected for the purpose.</p>


<p>A note “of clerke wage owing” in the accounts of St.
Michael’s in Bedwardine, Worcestershire, makes it appear
that there, ordinarily, each householder paid 1<i>d.</i> a quarter
for the clerk, although one person, to whom is prefixed the
title of “Mr.”, evidently pointing to a man of “class,” paid
a shilling each time. St. Mary-at-Hill, in London, paid its
clerk at the rate of &#163;6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year, and he also received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
certain offerings at obits, etc., kept in the church. The
regular wage was specially, although apparently not very
regularly, collected by the wardens.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_114" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_114.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">BLESSING OF FOOD BY HOLY WATER CLERK</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The actual payment of the clerk was sometimes a difficulty;
and Archbishop Boniface anticipates this possibility
by asserting the English custom of the parish paying for
his services. It was in consequence of this, he says, that
parishioners had asserted their right to make the appointment.
He directs that, should there be objection made to
this payment by any parish, the people should be compelled
to do their plain duty by ecclesiastical censures. On the
other hand, Archbishop Peckham seems to have thought it
reasonable that those who paid the money should elect to
the office, and held that the parishioners ought to appoint
the parish clerks to their offices.</p>

<p>Lyndwood speaks of a praiseworthy English custom,
according to which every father of a family made an offering
on the Sundays to the cleric who brought the holy water
to him; and that at Christmas the officer should have from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
each household a loaf, at Easter a certain number of eggs,
and in the autumn so much of the harvesting. It may also
be taken as an established custom that each quarter of the
year the clerk received a sum of money for his support levied
upon the entire parish. A curious entry in the accounts of
the church of St. Mary the Great at Cambridge, shows a
payment made by the parish “in reward to a yong man
that should have bene parish clerk,” suggesting that the
churchwardens wanted him, but the rector made another
appointment.</p>

<p>The Synod of Exeter, in 1287, so frequently referred to
in regard to the laws and customs of the English Church,
declares that, according to tradition, “the benefice of the
Blessed Water” was at first instituted to help poor clerks,
whilst they were studying and thus fitting themselves for
higher dignities. To this end Bishop Quevil directs, as already
pointed out, that in all churches not more than ten miles
distant from any school of a city or town, this purpose should
be borne in mind, and the office given to a poor scholar to
help him whilst at his studies. For this reason, no doubt, there
are instances in which the bishop insisted upon the removal
of a parish clerk who had married, and upon the appointment
of another, whose intention it was to proceed to the reception
of Holy Orders. At the same time it is quite clear that the
bishop did not lightly interfere in the appointment or removal
of any parish clerk. In one case, on November 13, 1386,
Bishop Brantyngham refused to take cognisance of the appeal
of the parishioners of Pont, in Cornwall, who, not being
content with the appointment made by their rector, had
caused the churchwardens to elect another. This the bishop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
altogether condemned, declaring that by law the appointment
was in the hands of the rector.</p>

<p>Besides attending to carry the Holy Water on the Sundays,
the clerk, according to the directions given in the tract called
“Cilium Oculi Sacerdotis,” was to assist the priest at the
altar, and to read the Epistle at Mass, when there was no
deacon or subdeacon. He might be vested in an alb when
he performed this service. It was part of his duty also to
teach the children of the parish, not only their prayers, creed,
and religion, but also their letters and “whatever singing they
ought to know.”</p>

<p>A curious document relating to the “Offesse of dekyn”
in Trinity Church, Coventry, in 1462, has been printed more
than once, and lately for the <i>Henry Bradshaw Society</i>, by
Dr. Wickham Legg. Some of the duties there set forth for
the “deacon” show that in this case he acted as parish clerk,
and his duties are most minutely described. He was to open
the door of the church at six o’clock, and have the chalice and
missal ready for the priest who said “the Trinity Mass:” on
all feasts he was to ring for Matins, and bring in the books for
the south side of the choir: he was to ring for the High Mass,
and then sing in the choir, and again at three o’clock for
Evensong. He shall be rector in the choir on the south side:
he is to see that there is a deacon to read the Gospel at every
High Mass.</p>

<p>Beside this he has the general care of the church: to see
that the floor be swept when it needs it, and that the snow is
taken off the roof and from out the gutters: that the font be
ready for the blessing on Holy Saturday, and palms before
Palm Sunday, and that palms be burned for ashes before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Ash Wednesday. For the blessing of the font he is to provide
three copies “for the priests to sing <i>Rex Sanctorum</i>.”
Every Sunday “he shall bear holy water to every house in
his ward, and he to have his due of every man, after his degree,
quarterly.” In the same way he must see that the holy
cake is ready every Sunday according to every man’s degree,
“and he shall bear the holy bread to serve the people in the
north syde of the church, and he to go to them on ‘twelfth
day’ for his offering to the repair of his surplice. On Shere
Thursday (the Thursday in Holy Week) and Holy Saturday
he is to get ready a barrell for the blessed water, and on the
former he is to have the ‘birch besom for the priest that
washes the altar’ and the three discipling rods.”</p>

<p>Moreover, at “every principal feast” he is to help the
churchwardens “to array the High Altar with clothes
necessary for it,” being ready for them “at the third peal
of the first Evensong.” He is to help “the churchwardens
to cover the altar and the rood in lent with lenten cloths,
and to hang the veil in the choir.” He and “his fellow”
is to look to the bells and provide ropes and grease, and
they are to divide the ringing fees between them. He is
“to cover the pulpit with a pall when any doctor preaches.”
He is to go vested in his surplice to accompany the parson
when he goes to take the Blessed Sacrament to the sick,
and “to fetch any corpse to the church.”</p>

<p>The second “deacon” or clerk, commonly called “the
fellow” of the first in this document, has also his special
duties assigned. Every week-day he is to ring the second
peal for Matins at half-past six. He is to see to the books
on the north side of the choir, and sing on that side as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
first “deacon” does for the south. At Evensong he shall
do in like manner, but “he shall be subdeacon every Sunday
and Holy-day at the procession and Mass, and read the
Epistle.” Generally he is to assist the “deacon” with the
choir books and processionals, and help to fold up the vestments
and albs, etc.</p>

<p>Beyond the above-named parish officials there were
obviously, many others whose services were occasionally
required. Amongst others are:</p>

<p>The <i>Sexton</i>, whose office was what it remains at the
present day. Such an official is named, in 1490, in the parish
accounts of Cratfield; but the extremely rare mention of the
name seems to show that in a mediæval parish each individual
family interested saw to the preparation of the last resting-place
of any of their dead relations.</p>

<p>The <i>Schoolmaster</i>, or, at any rate, one who occupied the
place of a teacher of the young, is more frequently named
in connection with the parish than many people would be
inclined to believe. An examination of the records of parish
life contained in the invaluable <i>Valor Ecclesiasticus</i> will reveal
the fact of the existence of both grammar and song schools
in many places in the sixteenth century. At Preston, in
Amounderness, for instance, a chantry priest was bound to
keep a “free grammar school” for the parish, and at the
suppression of the chantry, the lands left to support this were
seized by the Crown. The official returns by the Commissioners
for suppressing the chantries afford many examples of
these schools taught by priests and by clerks. These generally,
no doubt, existed by reason of special foundations made
by generous benefactors for the purpose; but in one case at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
least, at Lavenham, “the alderman of St. Peter’s Guild” finds
a priest who “teaches the children of the said town and acts
as secondary to the curate, who, without help of another
priest, is not able to serve the cure there.”</p>

<p>The <i>Bell-ringer</i> was an important official in every parish.
His first duty was to ring for the services in the church, and
to toll the bell for deaths, funerals, obits, or anniversary
services. If his wages were paid by the parish, his labours
were in most places one of the sources of income by which the
parish chest was replenished, as the fees charged brought in
more than the amount paid to him. In some places, besides
his duty in regard to the bells, he was appointed to look after
various lamps or lights. Thus at Swaffham, in Norfolk, one
Simon Blake appoints “a lamp to burn by his grave on all
holidays and Lord’s days, from Matins to Compline, and the
bellman of the town of Swaffham to take care of it.”</p>

<p>At times, too, the bellman was employed in making
collections for some church purpose. Thus at Sutherton,
in 1485, the bellman, named Saunder, was engaged in
soliciting money for keeping two lights at the High Altar,
and he was paid by the churchwardens for going to Lincoln
“to bring home the waxe,” for the making of candles for the
consecration of the church. At St. Nicholas’s Church, Great
Yarmouth, in 1511, the bellman was paid for covering the
images in Lent-time. But, so far as the parish was concerned,
the most important function of this official was his proclamation
of deaths and anniversaries. In one of the York wills
there is a bequest of 6<i>d.</i> to the bellman for announcing the
funeral of the testator. Sir Adam Outlaw, priest, bequeaths
a tenement to the West Lynn town bellman on condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
of his “going with his bell about the town” on his “year-day”
to ask the people to “pray for the souls of Thomas of
Acre and Muriel his wife, his (Sir Adam’s) soul, and the
souls of his benefactors.”</p>

<p>In like manner, the Guild of St. Botulph’s Church at
Boston employed the bellman to announce the anniversaries
of its brethren. Thus, in January the Sacrist was to
remember to send him round about the city to proclaim the
obit day of Richard Chapman, and proclaim each year his
will. At each street he was to ring his bell and say: “For
the sowles of Richard Chapeman and Alys his wyf, brother
and syster of Corpus Christi Gylde to-morne (<i>i.e.</i> to-morrow)
shall be theyre yere day,” for which service he was to receive
a penny. This crier was constantly being sent round on
similar errands for other guilds, and from these same
records the names of some eight such societies, besides the
Corpus Christi Guild, are known: that is, St. Mary’s Guild,
that of the Trinity, and those of St. George, St. Peter, the
“Felichyp of Heven,” Seven Martyrs, St. Katherine, and the
Apostles. The object of these constant proclamations was,
of course, to call the various members of fraternities and
societies to attend at funerals and anniversary masses and
pray for the souls of the brethren and sisters who had gone
before them to that future life, which in those days of simple
faith was hardly less a reality to all Christian folk than the
present world which their senses told them about.</p>

<p>The bells used by the bellmen seem, from some inventories,
to have been the property of the parish. They are
called “Rogation bells,” from their use in calling people
to the church, and they were rung in the funeral procession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
from the house of the deceased parishioner to the church.
In 1463, John Baret, of Bury St. Edmunds, directs that the
two bellmen, who go about the town on his death announcing
his funeral, are to have gowns given them. And at “my
yeer-day,” he adds, they are to have each 4<i>d.</i> for going about
the town to call on the inhabitants “to pray for my soul,
and for my faderis and modrys,” and the same for ringing on
the “month’s mind.”</p>

<p>Another remarkable custom, which seems to have been
no novelty in the middle of the fifteenth century, was the
use of a chime barrel set with the tune of the <i>Requiem
æternam</i>, the Introit of the Mass for the dead. This, as it
only ranged over five notes, was easily managed, and the
instrument was wheeled throughout the town, grinding out
this lament for some departed inhabitant. The John Baret
named above makes special arrangements for this to be done
at Bury on his decease, for thirty days after, and during the
following Lent-time.</p>

<p>Of people employed at various times and for diverse purposes
by the parish, there were a great many about whom
very little need be said. Over and above masons and carpenters
and women to wash surplices and albs and repair
vestments, who may be called regular employees, the
accounts of the churchwardens show that many others were,
from time to time, paid by the parish funds. One of the
most regular, naturally, when lights were so much used, was
the <i>Candlemaker</i>, who apparently travelled about from place
to place exercising his art. At Cowfield, in Sussex, for
instance, in the years 1471-85, the churchwardens’ payments
for candlemaking were at regular intervals, and besides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
finding the wax and the wages, the wardens supplied also
the board and lodging for the master workman. At Great
St. Mary’s, Cambridge, the wardens, in 1537, bought 35 lbs.
of wax, at 7<i>d.</i> a pound, “for the Sepulchre and Roode
lyghtes;” they paid 5<i>s.</i> for making it up, and 2<i>s.</i> 3&#189;<i>d.</i>
“for a dinner at the making.” At St. Mary-at-Hill, London,
“Roger Middelton, wax channdeler,” was paid “for
makyng of the said ryeve loen (92 lbs.) and olde wax, made
in tapris for the Bemelight and other tapris, prickettes, and
tenebre candilles, for every lb. a half-penny—11 shilling 9<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p>In the same way parishes employed travelling bookmakers,
that is, scribes and bookbinders and illuminators.
Thus, as an instance, at the beginning of the fifteenth century,
the wardens of St. Augustine’s Church, at Hedon, in
the East Riding, paid 10<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for parchment to make a book;
to Adam Skelton, a scribe, for writing it, 4<i>d.</i>; to “John
Payntor for a picture, 10<i>s.</i>,” and 6<i>d.</i> for the breakfasts of the
scribes. There is evidence that sometimes the curate of
a parish acted as a scribe, and received a fee for so doing;
sometimes clerics at other places were employed, as a clerk at
the Almonry at Canterbury, who wrote a book for the church
of St. Dunstan in that city.</p>

<p>The same applies also to the <i>Bookbinder</i>, who used to ply
his trade from place to place, repairing the old and making
new bindings for new and old manuscript service and music
books. So too the same evidence of the accounts of churchwardens
shows the <i>Painter</i>, the <i>Carver</i>, the <i>Silversmith</i>, the
<i>Gilder</i>, and the <i>Tinker</i> constantly at work in various places,
according to the needs and means and enterprise of the
English parochial authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>In all cases it was the work of the people. Through their
wardens they arranged, superintended, and finally settled the
accounts of these various travelling workmen and artists.
How they raised the money required for all the work that
was carried out during the last half of the fifteenth century
must always remain a mystery. Some account of their ways
of collecting funds for parochial purposes will appear in the
next chapter; but when all is said, the mystery remains.</p>

<p class="ph3">PAROCHIAL FINANCE</p>


<p>In view of the many expenses which devolved upon the
wardens in the working of a mediæval parish, it is
important to try to understand how they were able to
raise the necessary funds. In the first place, of course, it
must be understood that the churchwardens had nothing to
do with the tithes—that is, with the regular charge on the
produce of the land, which was from the first intended for
the support of the clergy, for the poor, and for the maintenance
of the chancel portion of the church’s fabric. These
were received in due course, according to the law, by the
parson, or vicar, or by their agent, without any reference to
the popular representatives of the parish as such, and except
for an occasional donation from the priest to the common
fund for some special purpose, the parish exchequer took
nothing whatever from the tithe due to the clergyman.</p>

<p>The methods by which the people of a parish raised
money for their works were many and various, and some of
them curious; some few of them must needs be touched
upon briefly in any account of the life of a mediæval parish.
In the first place, then, may be mentioned the occasional
<i>voluntary assessment</i> of the people of a parish, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
to their possessions, sometimes called “setts,” or “cess.”
This, however, was not a very common way of raising money,
and recourse was had to it, apparently, only in the case of
extraordinary repairs upon the church becoming necessary.
From the many examples that are to be found in the extant
accounts, the voluntary rate was evidently difficult to enforce,
especially when the amount claimed had, more or less, to be
proportioned to the property of individuals. Still, in some
places, it was clearly very successful as a means of raising
money; as, for instance, at Wigtoft, in Lincolnshire, where,
in 1525, the accounts show that the church was completely
repaired by money obtained by a voluntary rate. Here a list
of eighty-six inhabitants is given, who are assessed at sums
varying from 1<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> Although the unequal incidence
of the tax was evidently admitted by all, it was apparently
held that when the parish had made the rate, its vote was
binding upon every one. At St. Dunstan’s, Canterbury, in
1485, a church rate, or “cess,” produced &#163;4 5<i>s.</i> 1&#189;<i>d.</i>, in sums
varying from John Roper’s 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to Richard Crane’s 4<i>d.</i>;
whilst at the same time extra “gifts of devotion” are recorded
of sums varying from &#189;<i>d.</i> to 4<i>d.</i> Between 1504 and 1508
another parish “cess,” in the same place, produced nearly &#163;6.</p>

<p>Closely allied to a parochial rate, although not so universal,
nor, of course, possessing the binding force of a public
assessment, were <i>joint voluntary gifts</i> for special purposes.
Something in the way of decoration, or of a bell, a window,
a vestment, or a piece of plate was wanted, and the people,
as one account expresses it, immediately “drew themselves
together” to pay for it, or to purchase it. For instance, at
Morebath, a small uplandish parish in Somerset, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
borders of Devon, in 1538-9, some of the inhabitants bought
a new cope for their church at the cost of &#163;3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> From
1528, also, in the same place, the vicar gave up his rights
over certain tithes of wool to add to the sum then being
collected to purchase a “new suit of black vestments.” It
is perhaps worth noting that these were only obtained for
&#163;6 5<i>s.</i> in 1547, just before the alterations in religion made
them useless.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the fifteenth century a change is
noticeable in the accounts of the churchwardens. It evidently
became more and more common for them to possess
lands, and to have houses left to them, as trustees of the
parish; the revenues of these were used only for parochial
purposes, and mainly, perhaps, for the upkeep of lights and
the celebration of anniversaries. Running through all the
wills of this period, too, is a manifestation of the same spirit
of devotion to the parochial churches, with which the donors
had been connected during life, and the same eager desire
to leave something in money or in kind to them is everywhere
seen. These naturally, if not by express desire, came
into the charge and guardianship, not of the parson of the
place, but of the people’s wardens, who were responsible for
the Church goods.</p>

<p>Instances of such gifts are so numerous that the selection
of examples is rendered almost impossible, and they are
taken here almost at haphazard. At Woodchurch, in
Cheshire, in 1525, one James Godyker left to the wardens
of his parish church 20 marks to buy twenty bullocks to be
let for the purpose of bringing sufficient revenue to find an
extra priest. In Nottingham, a shop in “Shoemakers row”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
was left to sustain a lamp; in other places in that county
there are “divers lands to pay an extra priest, who has also
a house;” “money is bequeathed to be distributed unto the
poore yerly;” “arable land was given for a light;” “medow
land for a lamp;” a “stock of 5 sheep, valued at 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> each,
and one cow valued at 8<i>s.</i>;” “two stocks of money 10<i>s.</i> and
26<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in the tenure of Robert Braunesby, Edward Dawson,”
etc., and “20<i>s.</i> in the tenure of Richard Blank—the interest
being 4<i>d.</i> on every noble,” etc.</p>

<p>Then <i>collections</i> were made by the assent of the parish
at various times and in different ways. Thus <i>The Early
History of the Town and Port of Hedon</i>, in the East Riding
of Yorkshire, shows the wardens of St. James’ making
collections in the town for church purposes three times a
year. At the feast of St. Mary Magdalene they themselves
collected both through the town and in the fair, like the
wardens of St. Augustine’s. On the feast of St. John, during
Christmas week, boys were sent round with collecting bags,
and each boy received 1<i>d.</i> for his pains. In the parish of
St. Augustine’s, in the same place, there were many receipts
from these collections, such as: “collections in the city, 5<i>s.</i>;”
“in the church on the feast of the Circumcision, 10<i>s.</i>;” “on
St. Mary Magdalene’s day, with relics in the city, 15<i>s.</i>;”
“on all Sundays with the <i>tabula</i>, 8<i>s.</i>” This last form of
collecting seems to have been very popular at Hedon and
elsewhere, and probably refers to the method of carrying
round some holy picture to excite the devotion and generosity
of the people. In the same way, and with the same
end, in numberless places relics of the saints were taken
about by the collectors for the reverence of the faithful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
At St. Dunstan’s, Canterbury, the outdoor collections were
made by members of the various brotherhoods, which, to the
number of eight or nine, were attached to the church. In
the same way the parish cross, which may be considered to
be the corporation banner of the parishioners, was carried
round the city or district to remind the people of their
duty to assist in the corporate work and to stimulate their
devotion.</p>

<p>The times for making regular collections naturally varied
in different places. In the church of St. Helen’s, Worcester,
for instance, there seem to have been three yearly collections
for general church purposes, namely: <i>Lux fulgebit</i> Sunday
(Christmas), Paschaltide, and the “standing afore the church
at the Fayre.” These regular days did not, of course, interfere
with other special collections in the same parish, as “for
St. Katherine’s light,” “our Lady light,” “the Clerke’s
money,” “Peter’s farthings,” etc. At St. Edmund and St.
Thomas, Salisbury, special collections were made for the
fabric on every Good Friday and Easter day. On the latter
day, in one year in this parish, &#163;2 10<i>s.</i> 1&#189;<i>d.</i> were contributed
to the “font taper,” which would appear from other accounts
to be the name for the penny given by each man, and the
halfpenny given by each woman, who communicated on
Easter day—a contribution which was prohibited by some
bishops, as likely to be misunderstood. With this view, the
payment was ordered to be transferred till the Sunday following
the Easter Communion.</p>

<p>Collections for specific objects are, perhaps, the most
common in all parochial accounts. In one, the holy water
vat for the asperges and the thurible are said to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
purchased by collections “made by boys of the parish.” In
another, that of St. Mary-at-Hill, such collections were very
constant; money for “candlesilver” was regular, and for such
objects as the new “Rood loft,” etc., frequent. At St.
Petrock’s, Exeter, in 1427, there was an agreement made as
to the candle money, which in those days was obviously a
constant and a heavy expense in every parish. It was to
this effect—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Ordinans made by the eight men for gatheryn to the waxe
sylver kep to the lighte beforr the high-cross, whyche saye is, that
every man and hys wyffe to the waxe shall paye yerely one peny,
and every hired servant that taketh wages a hallfe peny, and every
other persons at Ester, takyn no wage, a farthyng.”</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes the wardens placed a collecting-box in the
church to receive general offerings towards parochial expenses.
This seems to have led at times to difficulties with the parson,
and at one time it was prohibited. Bishop Quevil, of Exeter,
for example, says that the practice introduced into some
parishes of putting a box, either into the church or outside,
to gather alms, has led “to contentions between the rector
and his parishioners.” Some of the latter have further
declared that “it was a better almsdeed to put money into
the common box than to give it to the priest,” and in this
way the priests do not get their accustomed offerings. They
do not, for instance, get from the laity their donations
towards the candles on the Feast of the Purification and
other feasts of the year, “according to laudable custom,” but
these gifts go into the hands of the wardens “for a light
before the great crucifix, etc.” The bishop consequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
orders that all such collecting-boxes be removed from the
churches or cemeteries of his diocese at once.</p>

<p>Regular Sunday collections were made in certain places
for the wants of the parish. The Hythe churchwardens,
although depending mainly upon gifts and legacies for the
money necessary to satisfy
their obligations, had public collections
on twenty-six Sundays
in the year. The people were
apparently few, and the collections
did not produce much;
the total being only 34<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for
the six months, and the individual
collection varying from
6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; except on Easter
Sunday, when the collectors
seem to have gathered 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
In 1498 the parochial needs at
Leverton, in Lincolnshire, became
so great that the two
wardens, Christopher Pyckyll
and Robert Tayler, made an
appeal at “ye gathering of the townschyp and in the kyrke,”
with the result that they collected the sum of &#163;4 13<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>
for the building of the steeple.</p>

<p>One of the most regular sources of parochial receipt was
the fee for burial in the church or churchyard. To judge
from several entries in various accounts, the cost of opening
a grave in the nave of the church was 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, which belonged
to the parish. Thus at St. Mary’s, Cambridge, in 1515, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
the churchwardens’ receipts there are two such items, one
for the burial of Calo Fremeston, and the other for that
of a “Mr. Wise.” In London, as we might perhaps expect,
the fee was greater; in fact, in the accounts of St. Mary-at-Hill,
in 1522-3, among the “Casuell Resceites” are
entered those “for the buryall of John Colers in the chirche,
13<i>s.</i>; for the buryall of William Holyngworthi’s child, 2<i>s.</i>;
for the buryall of a stranger in the great churchyard, 12<i>d.</i>;
for the buryall of a priest in the pardon churchyard, 2<i>s.</i>; for
the buryall of Robert Hikman in St. Ann’s Chapel, 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>”
This same year a regular table of “fees to be paid” to the
parish for burials in the church, churchyard, or pardon-churchyard
attached to the church of St. Mary’s was drawn
up. From this we learn that for every grave opened, in
either of the two chapels of St. Stephen and St. Katherine,
13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> was to be paid: for every man, woman, and child
buried “without the choir door of any of the said chapels
... unto the west door of the aisle going south or north,”
10<i>s.</i> was to be paid; and for any burial “from the cross
aisle to the west end of the church,” 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> The price of
the ground thus varied according to the position, and similarly
the clerk’s fee varied for breaking the ground: it was 3<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
in the first case, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in the second, and 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in the
third. These payments, of course, had nothing to do with
the fee of the clergyman: this was fixed at 1<i>d.</i> as a minimum,
but generally more was given according to the means of the
family. The smallness of the fee may perhaps be explained
by the English custom of “mortuaries,” that is, the gift of
the best or second best possession of the deceased to the
church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In some places (says Bracton) the church has the best beast,
or the second or the third best, and in some places nothing; and
therefore the custom of the place is to be considered ... and
although no one is bound to give anything to the church for burial,
nevertheless, where the laudable custom exists the Lord the Pope
does not wish to break through it.”</p>
</div>

<p>Immediately connected with the subject of burials were
two practices, which brought some additions to the parochial
exchequer. The first was the custom of special payments
made for the use of the best cross, etc., if the parish was
possessed of one. It would seem that generally, besides the
processional cross, every parish had a second cross used at
funerals, but occasionally they had either purchased or in
some way become possessed of a more magnificent and
elaborate crucifix. For the use of this last the wardens as a
rule made a charge, and this payment brought some money
into the common purse. Thus the churchwardens’ accounts
of St. Ewen’s, Bristol, show that, about the middle of the
fifteenth century, the parish made a precious crucifix of this
kind. People contributed all manner of broken silver and
jewels for the work, and all sorts and conditions of men and
women gave of their riches or their poverty to it. Alice
Sylkwoman, for instance, gave a ring, and Thomas Fisher an
old spoon, etc. When the work of art was finished it was
weighed before the parson and the parishioners, and, not
counting the bar of iron in its centre, it was found to be
116 ounces of “clere sylver and gold.” No sooner was it
made than it was arranged to charge a special fee for its use,
and in 1459-60 one of the parishioners, “Thomas Phelyp,
barber,” paid the fee “for the best cross at his Wyf’s buryeng.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>In the same way the churchwardens appear to have let
out the bier and lights to be used at funerals for the payment
of a fee. The parish lights especially are very frequently
named in the accounts of the churchwardens; although not
infrequently the torches were furnished by the various guilds,
the members of which had sometimes the right of hiring
them for the burials of friends. In this way, to take but one
example, the wardens of the parish of Ashburton in 1523-24
let out “the best cross and parish tapers” to a neighbouring
parish, and received 21<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for the transaction; a very notable
addition to the parochial income. Parishioners also paid
for the use of the parish cross and candlesticks at funerals
in their own church. In the same way, the vestments and
plate and hangings were lent for a payment to other parishes
for a great funeral or festival. In the accounts of St. Mary-at-Hill,
for instance, 4<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> were paid by “the churchwardens of
All Hallows in Lombard Street for hyryng of the church stuffe.”</p>

<p>A further source of income was found towards the beginning
of the sixteenth century when the letting of pews
or seats in the church became a custom. The revenue from
this was always successfully claimed by the wardens in behalf
of the parishioners, on the ground, no doubt, that the nave of
the church where these seats had been erected was their
property, and that the fee for the exclusive right of any special
portion belonged to them, on the same principle as the money
for the sale of any particular part for a grave. This practice
of letting pews for the use of individuals has already been
sufficiently illustrated by examples.</p>

<p>The practice of leaving sums of money by will to the
wardens for definite purposes was almost universal in the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
half of the fifteenth century and at the beginning of the
sixteenth. In the accounts of St. Mary-at-Hill, in London,
are to be found such entries as: “Received of William Blase,
Barbowrez (<i>i.e.</i> the barber’s) wife, for painting of an image
of Our Lady within the Church—20<i>d.</i>,” and many other
examples have previously been given of sums left by deceased
parishioners for special work in their parish churches, such as
the erection or adornment of the rood or its loft. Bishop
Hobhouse has noticed in the Somerset churchwardens’ accounts
that there was hardly any conceivable kind of property that
was not handed over to the wardens for church purposes, either
to produce income by being leased out, or to be sold for the
benefit of the common exchequer. Live stock of every sort is
represented—cows, oxen for ploughing, rams, sheep, lambs,
bees, cocks and hens, geese, and even pigs are named. At
Morebath almost every altar had its endowment of sheep,
and at St. Mary’s, in the city of Bath, there was a little flock
managed by the wardens. In the former small parish there
were no fewer than eight different accounts kept, and “a
supernumerary body” of from three to nine parishioners were
added to the wardens “as controllers of the parish stock.”
At Bromley, Margaret White, widow, who died in June,
1538, by her will gave to the church one hive of bees to
support the light of All Hallows, one hive to support the
light of the Sepulchre, and a third to the light of St. Anthony.
Also to the keeping of her obit she gave two kine, and
directed that the obit should be kept “out of the increase
of the said kine,” and her name placed on the bede-roll,
and that Mass be said and bread and cheese and drink given
to four poor people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>In other places gifts in kind appropriate to the locality,
such as malt, barley, wheat, etc., appear on the roll of
accounts. At Walberswick, in Suffolk, in 1451, one Thomas
Comber handed over to the people’s wardens 2500 herrings;
another gave a set of fishing-nets. At Wigtoft, a village
near Boston, “a long-ladder” was given to the church;
whilst in the same place a parishioner, named Peter Saltweller,
paid a yearly rent of 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for a “salt pan,” or pit
for making salt, which had been given to the church.</p>

<p>Many of the gifts in kind were, of course, sold. Thus,
for the Walberswick herrings the wardens obtained 1<i>s.</i>, and
the set of fishing-nets brought in no less than 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> In
the same parish, in 1500, one John Almyngham left by
will, dated October 7, a sum, large in those days, of &#163;20
to his parish church. Ten pounds were to be expended
by the wardens in purchasing “a peyer of organys.” “Item
with the residue,” he says, “I will a canopy over the High
Auter well done with Our Lady and four angels, and the
Holy Ghost (probably a dove to contain the Blessed Sacrament)
going up and down with a chain.”</p>

<p>In 1483-4 the parishioners of St. Edmund’s and St.
Thomas’s, Salisbury, contributed all kinds of articles to be
the common goods of the parish, or else to be sold for what
they would fetch. From the wife of a barber in the city
there is recorded the present of “a brass dish and a plate.”
At another time, “for writing the names in the book,” or
bede-roll, one William Dyngyn gave to the wardens “a
red girdle” ornamented “with silver and gold.” One of
the favourite gifts at this time for people to make to their
churches was “a set of beads,” or, to call it by the modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
name, “a rosary.” Again and again this kind of gift is
recorded, and so also is the sale of the same for the benefit
of the common purse. For example, in the accounts of
St. Mary the Great, Cambridge, may be seen numerous
instances of this. In 1540, for example, there is entered the
following—“<i>memorandum</i>: that at the feast of St. John
the Baptist ... a pair of silver beads and two other pair
of corall, gauded with silver, were sold by the churchwardens
to James, goldsmith of Saint Benet’s parish ... by the
consent of most part of the parishioners.” “Item the collar
of baudryk of gold, having 9 links enamelled of gold, with
the ouche of St. Nicholas and little monstre or Relic of
St. Nicholas’ oil, is taken from the custody of the churchwardens
to be sold at Stourbridge fair by agreement and
consent also of the parishioners.” At Walberswick, to turn
again to that parish for an example, in 1498 the wardens
acknowledge the receipt of 4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for “a pair of beads
that were Margaret Middleton’s.” So, too, at Pilton, in
Somerset, in 1515, one of the parishioners paid the churchwardens
10<i>d.</i> for a set of beads, which had been given
them to dispose of; and at Yatton another pair “of amber”
were sold for 7<i>d.</i>, which was credited to the common stock.</p>

<p>It is well to note, however, that gifts made for some
special purpose, for a particular altar, or statue, etc., were
not disposed of in the way described above, but were
preserved, and the names of the donors were kept alive
by means of the bede-rolls, which will be subsequently
spoken about. What apparently the parishioners held that
they had a right to sell for the common good of the parish,
were gifts made with the donor’s expressed or implied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
intention that this should be done; and goods, plate, or
vestments, which had been previously purchased by the
parish, and which, as was held in those days, certainly
could be sold to purchase other goods or ornaments, or
to carry out some necessary parochial work.</p>

<p>Goods of all kinds, given for a special purpose and held
by the churchwardens as trustees, were protected by ecclesiastical
legislation. The Synod of Exeter, for example,
in 1287, orders the wardens to keep all such presents in
careful custody, to produce them when called upon by
authority, and not to turn them to any other use than
that for which they were originally given. This applies,
the Constitution declares, to the revenues of chantries and
altars, and even to the lights provided for them, and this
property may never be alienated, except in case of some
great necessity, when the leave of the archdeacon, or at
any rate of the rector, must be first obtained.</p>

<p>The names of some few other parish collections may
here be usefully recorded. <i>Dowelling</i>, or dwelling-house
money, was a tax or rate levied for parochial purposes
on each household—a church rate, in fact. This assessment
was sometimes known as <i>smoke-money</i>, or <i>smoke-farthing</i>,
meaning the contribution made from each family hearth
or house. Sometimes this was evidently known as <i>Pentecostal</i>,
and it then referred to the offerings made by the
parishioners at Whitsuntide to the parish priest. “Pentecostal
oblations,” varying in amount from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, are
entered for many years in the churchwardens’ accounts of
Aldworth, Berks. “Smoke-money,” or “smoke-silver,” is
said also to have been a money payment made to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
parson in lieu of a tithe of wood; but the name certainly
appears in some churchwardens’ accounts as a contribution
to the parish, and not to the priest. For instance, at Bromley,
in 1527-8, “smoke-farthings” produced 14<i>s.</i> for the common
parochial purse, and “dowelling-money” 9<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> At Laverton,
in Lincolnshire, each householder apparently gave 1&#189;<i>d.</i>
as his share of “smoke-money;” and at St. Edmund’s and
St. Thomas’s, Salisbury, the tax was known as “smoke-silver,”
or “smoke-farthings.”</p>

<p>At Easter time the churchwardens had to collect “Peter’s
pence,” “Rome fardynges,” “Rome’s scot,” or “Peter farthings,”
the contribution from each household to the Pope.
It is well to remark, however, that it is obvious, from the
accounts of this contribution to be found, that not more
than 50 per cent. of the amount collected ever found
its way into the papal coffers. The wardens collected
the money and paid it to the archdeacon at the time of
visitation. At St. Mary the Great, Cambridge, for example,
they paid “at ye visytacion, for Rome Fardynges 22&#189;<i>d.</i>”
Great care was taken to secure the punctual payment of
these dues to the Holy See, and warnings were issued
when the parish was in arrears. For continual neglect
to pay it was punished with interdict.</p>

<p>Lastly, there was another very general form of collection
made by the churchwardens, called variously “wax-silver,”
“candle-silver,” “Easter money,” or “Paschal money.” These
were payments made in many parishes towards the annual
expenses of the parish in finding candles and lamps to
burn in the churches. In some places the amount paid
by each parishioner was &#189;<i>d.</i> Besides the above, there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
various forms of contribution in different places; as, for
example, special payments for “the holy loaf,” or blessed
bread. An examination of the various extant churchwardens’
accounts will show that these officials were never at a loss
to obtain money from their fellow-parishioners when they
needed it for any special purpose. One great resource,
which apparently never failed them, took the form of social
meetings at the Church House, or elsewhere; but as to
these gatherings more will have to be said in a subsequent
chapter.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE PARISH CHURCH SERVICES</p>


<p>As the church was from the earliest times the centre
of the parish, and the priest the head of his flock
and the chief person—the parson—of the district, it
is natural to look for the first indications of all parochial life
in the church itself. From the cradle to the grave, as it has
often been said, through the clergy, religion extended its
care to every soul, and exerted its influence over man, woman,
and child in every parochial district, mainly by means of the
Church services and the administration of the Christian
Sacraments. In this and the following chapter it is proposed
to examine the nature and extent of these influences in
pre-Reformation parochial life.</p>

<p><i>Daily Mass.</i>—In the first place it is proper to speak of the
perpetual round of prayer and Eucharistic sacrifice known as
the daily Mass. Archbishop Cranmer, in his works on the
“Supper,” testifies to the devotion of the people generally to
their morning Mass. He represents them as “saying, ‘This
day have I seen my Maker;’ and ‘I cannot be quiet except
I see my Maker once a day.’” The Mass was regarded, as
the author of <i>Dives and Pauper</i> says, as “the highest prayer
that holy church can devise for the salvation of the quick and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
the dead,” in which “the priest offereth up the highest
sacrifice and the best offering that any heart can devise, that
is Christ, God’s Son in Heaven, under the form of bread and
wine.”</p>

<p>According to Lyndwood’s gloss on Archbishop Peckham’s
Constitution, every priest in those days was supposed to
offer up his Mass as frequently as possible, unless he was
prevented by some bodily infirmity, or some personal and
adequate reason made him abstain from daily celebration. In
that case, very frequently, the parishioners would themselves
provide for the morning Mass to be said by some paid
chaplain. In one case, in the diocese of London, in the
fourteenth century, the people seriously complain to their
bishop that their vicar will not secure the services of a
chaplain and a clerk, for whom they had agreed to pay, to
give them Mass “every day.”</p>

<p>At Henley-on-Thames, in 1482, “the Mayor and Commonalty”
arranged that the priest of the altar of the Blessed
Virgin Mary should say Mass every day at 6 a.m., and the
chantry priest of St. Katherine’s at 8 o’clock. In large
churches, where there were many chaplains and chantry
priests, the Masses followed one another continuously: thus,
for example, at Lincoln Cathedral the early morning Mass
was said at 5 o’clock each day in St. Chad’s Chapel, but
the chaplain, whose duty it was to say it, was not bound to
be at midnight Matins. The same may be said of Lichfield.
The other daily Masses were to be each hour, from 6 a.m.
till 10, when the High Mass was begun. After the consecration
of this sung Mass, the last daily Mass, intended for
travellers, was to be begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>These early morning Masses were called by various
names, of which “Morrow Mass” and “Jesu Mass” were
the most common. In the Chantry Certificates a great
number of entries of parcels of lands, etc., for the support
of some daily Mass in the early morning, show how popular
this service was in pre-Reformation days. In one place,
in the county of Nottingham, the chantry suppressed is
declared to have been founded for a priest “to say Mass
every morning before sonne rysing, for such as be travellers
by the way, and to maintain God’s service there; which
town is also a thoroughfare towne.” At Barnards’ Castle,
the Guild of Holy Trinity paid for a priest “to say Mass
daily at six o’clock in the morning, and to be resident at
Matins, Mass, and Evensong, and to keep a free grammar
school and a song school for all the children of the town.”
At Ipswich, “Mr. Alfrey’s chantry was founded for a priest
to sing the ‘Morowe Mass,’ in the parish church at St.
Matthew;” whilst at Newark the chantry priest of St. Mary
Magdalene’s had to say Mass for the people at 4 o’clock
in the morning. Most of the instances recorded show that
the “Morrow Mass,” whether at daybreak or at 4 or 5
or 6 o’clock, was endowed by benefactors with the revenues
of lands or tenements. Sometimes, however, the stipend of
the priest was paid by money collected for the purpose from
the parishioners. At Bury St. Edmunds, for instance, the
greater part of the necessary money for the early-mass priest
was “gathered wekely of the devotion of the parishioners.”
The churchwardens’ accounts of St. Edmund’s and St.
Thomas’s, Salisbury, show that a certain “fraternity” paid for
a priest to say “the Morrow Masse of Jesus,” they also paid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
for a torch and 6 lbs. of tallow candles for “the said Morrowe
Masse prest in Wynter.” In the parish of St. Peter-Cheap,
London, the Wardens paid the stipend for a curate to say
Mass every morning at six o’clock, and the wages of a clerk
to serve him.</p>

<p>At St. Martin’s Outwich, London, the sum of 33<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
was found each half-year as the reward of the priest who
said the Morrow Mass. In 1472, one of the parishioners of
St. Mary-at-Hill, London, left to the churchwardens of the
church certain lands and houses to find a priest to say Mass
daily, “immediately after the morowe masse, in the said
church of St. Mary, to be sung, yf the morowe masse in the
same chirche be continued as heretofore it was wont to be
and now is used, or ellse in defaute of the same morowe
masse, that my said Prieste syng daily reasonable tymely his
masse in stede and tyme of the morrowe masse....” Then,
after saying that this chaplain will, of course, assist at all the
church services, the donor adds: “also that the said Priest
say every werkeday in the said Chirch of Seynt Mary atte
hill, his matens, pryme and hours, evensong and complene
and all his other prayers and services, by hymself or with
his felowes preestes of the same chirch.” In this church also
the accounts show that the wardens paid one of the priests
an extra fee of 5<i>s.</i> a quarter for taking the “Morowe Masse.”</p>

<p>At St. Mary Woolnoth, to take but one more example,
Symonde Eyre, sometime Mayor of London, and draper,
established a fraternity of our Blessed Lady St. Mary the
Virgin. There was to be a “Mass by note” and also “two
psalms by note,” one in honour of Our Lady, the other in
honour of St. Thomas of Canterbury, to be sung by a priest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
clerk, and children. To pay for this he gave the tavern
called the “Cardinal,” etc. In 1492 the property was found
not to be sufficient to support this, and another parishioner,
Sir Hugh Bryce, alderman and goldsmith, left to the churchwardens
other property to maintain this custom, namely,
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> more to the priest, and 20<i>s.</i> “for that the clerk shall
daily kepe an anthem or <i>Salve</i> before the Crucifix in the
body of the said Church, with <i>Aves</i> of our Lady.” The
Masses are to be sung as follows: every Monday, Tuesday,
Thursday, and Saturday a Mass of Our Lady; every
Wednesday a “Missa de Requiem;” and every Friday a
Mass “in honour of the glorious name of Jesus....”</p>

</figure>

<p>It may, then, be taken as certain that, generally speaking,
Mass was celebrated daily in most of the parish churches. It
is equally certain that this was fairly attended by those
whose duties permitted them to be present. The <i>Prymer</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
of 1538, in giving the duties of the week, thus speaks of
Monday:—</p>

<p>So, too, <i>The Young Children’s Book</i>, which is dated about

<p>Andrew Borde also, in his <i>Regyment</i>, says that after rising
and dressing, “then great and noble men doth use to here
Masse, and other men that can not do so, but must apply
theyr busyness, doth serve God with some prayers, surrendrynge
thankes to hym for hys manyfolde goodnes, with
askynge mercye for theyr offences.” In the Introduction to
<i>The Lay Folks Mass Book</i> Canon Simons has gathered together
a considerable number of authorities for holding that
people were supposed to hear their daily Mass, with the
exception of those “common people,” who were employed on
work and could only be present on the Sundays and holidays.
In Wynkyn de Worde’s <i>Boke of Kervynge</i> the chamberlain
is instructed “at morne” to “go to the chyrche or chapell
to your soveraynes closet and laye carpentes and cuysshens
and pute downe his boke of prayers, then drawe the curtynes.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
And so, too, Robert of Gloucester says of William the
Conqueror, reflecting the manners of the time in which he
himself wrote: “In chyrche he was devout ynou, for hym
non day abyde that he na hurde masse and matyns and
evenson[g] and eche tyde.” And Canon Simmons adds—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But that the rule of the church was not a dead letter is perhaps
most unmistakably shown by the matter-of-course way in which
hearing mass before breaking fast is introduced as an incident in the
everyday life of knights and other personages in works of fiction,
which, nevertheless, in their details were no doubt true to the
ordinary habits of the class they intended to portray....”</p>
</div>

<p>For example, in <i>Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight</i>
Gawayne, after the lady has kissed him—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dos hir forth at ye dore, with outen dyn more</div>

<p>And so again the lord hears Mass before he eats, and goes
hunting at daybreak—</p>

<p>The Venetian traveller, who at the beginning of the sixteenth
century wrote his impressions of England, was struck
by the way in which the people attended to their religious
duties in this matter of morning Mass. “They all attend
Mass every day, he writes, and say many <i>Paternosters</i> in
public. The women carry long rosaries in their hands, and
any who can read, take the Office of Our Lady with them,
and with some companion recite it in church verse by verse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
in a low voice, after the manner of churchmen.” This story
of English people going to a daily Mass might perhaps be
considered as one of the proverbially curious stories told
even by otherwise intelligent strangers from foreign countries,
were it not that it is confirmed by the assertion of another
Venetian some years later. This latter declares that every
morning “at daybreak he went to Mass arm-in-arm with
some nobleman or other.”</p>

<p>Even in the case of those whose business kept them from
the church itself, it is probable that they were united in spirit
to the great act of worship which was
being offered in God’s house, in their
name as well as in that of all those
present. The bell known as the Sanctus
Bell, because it was rung at the saying
of the Sanctus at the beginning of the
Canon of the Mass, and also at, what
was considered the most sacred time
of the Sacrifice, the Consecration and
Elevation of the Elements, was intended
to give notice to those working in the
fields or within reach of its sound, of
these most solemn parts of the Mass.
Sometimes this bell was set in the rood
beam, sometimes in a turret rising from
the chancel arch, and sometimes from
the nave gable. Occasionally it was of considerable size;
but apparently more frequently it was small, and rung by
hand. Even then, however, according to some antiquaries,
the clerk or server rang the hand-bell out of the low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
side window, which is frequently still existing in parish
churches, in order to warn people outside that the Mass was
going on. That this was really the practice is hardly doubtful
in view of a Constitution of Archbishop Peckham, in
1281. He directs in this, that “at the time of the Elevation
of the body of Our Lord, a bell be rung on one side
of the church (<i>in uno latere</i>), that the people who cannot
be at daily Mass, no matter where they may be, whether in
the fields or in their homes, may kneel down, and so gain
the indulgences granted by many bishops” for this act of
devotion.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the people in the church, and in particular
during Mass time, was a matter upon which in
mediæval times all were carefully instructed. Myrc, in his
<i>Instructions for Parish Priests</i>, bids the clergy tell their
parishioners that on entering the house of God they should
leave outside “many wordes” and “ydel speche,” that they
should put away all vanity and “say their <i>Pater noster</i> and
<i>Ave</i>.” They are to be warned not to stand about or loll
against the pillars or the wall, but kneel on the floor—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And pray to God wyth herte meke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To give them grace and mercy eke.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the Gospel is read they are to stand up and, blessing
themselves at the <i>Gloria tibi, Domine</i>, they are to continue
standing until the reading is finished, and then they are to
kneel down again. When they hear the bell ring for the
Consecration, all, “bothe young and olde,” are to fall on
their knees, and, holding up both their hands, pray softly to
themselves thus:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Jesu, Lord, welcome Thou be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In form of bread as I Thee see.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jesu! for Thy holy name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shield me to-day from sin and shame,” etc.,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>or in some similar way. The most ordinary prayers to be
used at this time, according to the books of religious instruction
then in vogue, were the <i>Salve lux mundi</i>: “Hail, Light of
the world, Word of the Father; Hail thou true Victim, the
living and entire Flesh of God made true Man,” and the
<i>Anima Christi, sanctifica me</i>, supposed by many people to
be a devotional prayer of more modern origin.</p>

<p>Besides attendance at the morning Mass, there is little
evidence of any other ordinary daily use of the church. It
would be altogether wrong, however, to conclude that God’s
house, standing open as it did all the day through, did not
attract people to it for private and unrecorded devotion. One
or two chance references in documents, such as “Proofs of
age” and “Depositions,” seem to point to the fact that the
churches were, in fact, used during the day by people seeking
Almighty God’s guidance and help, by passing strangers, and
by labourers returning from their daily toil. It has already
been pointed out that in the case of a Chantry, the benefactor
who founded it made it a condition that the priest should
recite his Breviary in the church either by himself or with
others. This practice was recommended to priests generally,
and there is no reason to suppose that it was not carried out
by them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Let all the Ministers of the Church,” says Bishop Quevil, in
1287, “be diligent and careful in saying the Divine Office. In the
name of the Holy Trinity we order every minister of the church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
carefully, devoutly, clearly, and entirely, without any cutting down,
to sing or say the night and day Divine Office appointed by General
Council. Let those who chant it remember to pause in the middle
of the verse, and let no one begin any verse before the other has
finished the verse preceding;” and, in regard specially to parish
churches, the same Constitution ordered that “parish priests shall
not leave their churches until on feast days and Holy days they shall
have said the canonical hours either before or after Mass: and that
no priest say his Mass before he has done his duty to his Creator by
saying Matins and Prime.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the same way, in 1364, the Synod of Ely, held by
Bishop Simon Langham, ordered that priests were to say the
whole office in their churches, and</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“that all pastors of souls and parish priests, when they had finished
the recitation of their Office in their churches, shall apply themselves
diligently to prayer and the reading of Holy Scripture, in order that,
by a knowledge of the Scriptures, they may be ready, as becomes
their office, to satisfy any one who asks for the reason of their faith
and hope. Let them ever be earnest in the teaching and the effect of
Scripture on their work, like the poles in the rings of the ark of the
covenant, so that their prayer may be nourished and rendered fruitful
by assiduous reading as by their daily bread.”</p>
</div>

<p>In some of the larger parish churches a considerable
portion of the Divine Office, as well as the Mass, was sung
daily. A note in the churchwardens’ accounts of St. Michael’s,
Cornhill, London, written in 1538, asks prayers for “Richard
Atfield, sometime parson of the church ... for that he,
with consent of the bishop, ordained and established Mattins,
High Mass, and Evensong to be sung daily, in the year 1375.”
This had been done regularly for 163 years, and the hours
at which the various services were held would appear to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
been: Matins at 7 a.m., High Mass at 9, and Evensong on
work-days at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>In many of the larger churches, also, benefactors or
fraternities had arranged for the singing of a <i>Salve</i> or other
anthem of Our Lady in the evening time at her altar or
statue. At these times also tapers would usually be lit in
honour of Christ’s holy Mother. In the church of St. Mary-at-Hill,
for example, in 1353, the practice existed, for in that
year a parishioner left money to support a priest, and among
his duties it is said “that he be every day in the same chirch
after evensong, at the time of syngyng of <i>Salve Regina</i>, and
that he sing the same, or else help the syngers after his
cunnyng, in honour of our blessed lady the Virgin.” At
other places, as at St. Edmund’s, Salisbury, for instance, the
singing of the <i>Salve</i> was only undertaken at stated times.
In this case the Fridays in Lent were apparently chosen for
this evening hymn to Our Lady.</p>

<p>Chaucer, in <i>The Prioress’s Tale</i>, makes a little boy, who
doubtless had taken his part in this, ask his older schoolfellow
what another such anthem of Our Blessed Lady
meant—the <i>Alma Redemptoris</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sunday in the Parish Church.</i>—It is time to pass to the
consideration of what took place in the mediæval parish
church on the ordinary Sundays of the year. In the
<i>Prymer</i> of 1538 are to be found some verses called <i>The
Dayes of the Weke Moralysed</i>, in which the duty of the
Christian in regard to Sunday is thus set forth:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am Sonday ye honourable,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hede of all the weke dayes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That day all thyng labourable</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ought to rest and gyve lawd and prayers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To our Creatour, that alwayes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wuolde have us rest after travayle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Man-servant and thy beeste he sayes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the other or thyn avayle.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first question that arises is as to the attendance of the
people at the Matins which preceded the parochial Mass.
It would seem to be quite certain that even in the smallest
churches on Sundays and Holy days the Office was recited
by the priests, or, in the cases where there was only one, by
the priest and his clerk in the early morning. Further, from
the various directions and instructions given to the people,
it seems practically certain that they were not only expected
to be at the Matins, but, as far as possible, were actually
present at them.</p>

<p>The evidence of the various Visitations shows that even
the smallest churches were expected to be provided by the
rector with the Matin books. For example, in the Visitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
of churches in the diocese of Exeter, in 1440, there were constant
notes as to the “<i>libri matutinales</i>” being in need of
repair, or being “sufficiently good.” In one case it is stated
that the rector had built a new chancel, had done much to
the rectory house, and had “provided good Matin books.”
In another the rector is said to have “hired a scribe to write
new books.” In the same diocese, in 1301, it was made
an article of complaint, by the parishioners of Colebrooke,
at the Visitation, that their vicar did not “sing Matins
on the Greater Feasts with music” (<i>cum nota</i>), and that he
“only said Mass every other day.” The general orders for
the provision of books for this service in the Constitutions of
the English Church is sufficient evidence that the service was
faithfully said or sung.</p>

<p>Myrc, in his <i>Instructions</i>, says that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The holy day only ordeynet was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To here goddes serves and the Mas.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And spare that day in holynes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And leve alle other bysynes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And Langland, after saying that all business, hunting, and
labour is to stop on the Lord’s day, says, “And up-on Sonedays
to cease—godes servyce to huyre, Bothe Matyns and
Masse—and after mate, in churches to huyre here evesong,
every man ought.”</p>

<p>That this was really done, and moreover that the English
practice was to go to the parish church and hear Matins
before breaking the morning fast, appears in a passage of
Sir Thomas More’s writings.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some of us laymen,” he says, “thinke it a payne ones in a
weeke to ryse so soon fro sleepe, and some to tarry so long fasting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
as on the Sonday to com and hear out they Matins. And yet is not
Matins in every parish, neyther, all thynge so early begonne norfully
so longe in doyng, as it is in the Charterhouse, ye wot wel.”</p>
</div>

<p>In a fifteenth-century book of instructions there are given
as practical examples of the vice of sloth—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When a man castis hym to leze in reste; to slepe mekell; to
be long in bed, late comyng to God’s service; havyng non savour
nor swetnes in prechyng, nor in bedys byddyng, nor no devocyon in
Matynes nor in Evesong.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to obtain any exact information
as to the time when Matins were said or sung in the English
parochial churches. That the service was begun at an early
hour we must suppose, even if we had not the authority of
Sir Thomas More for the fact. To conclude from the case
of St. Michael’s, Cornhill, just quoted, it may be judged that
the hour for Matins was at 6 or 7 in the morning, and
that High Mass would commence at 9 or 10. An interval
between was thus left, during which the parishioners would
have time to return home and break their fast. If the occupation
of two hours or so on a Sunday morning, and another
service in the afternoon, may appear somewhat excessive to
our modern notions, we must bear in mind that it was in
those days clearly understood and accepted as a first principle
of religion that the meaning of the Sunday rest and
freedom from work was, in the first place, that the Christian,
who was occupied all the rest of the week mainly in temporal
affairs, might have time to attend to the things of his soul.
His chief duty on the Sunday was, as one of the Synodical
Constitutions puts it, “to hear divine service and Holy Mass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
to pray and to listen to the voice of the priest instructing
him in his belief and duty.”</p>
<figure class="figright illowp57" id="i_155" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_155.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">HOLY WATER VAT AND SPRINKLER</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The parochial, or High Mass, as the chief sung Mass
was called, was preceded on each Sunday by the public and
solemn blessing of the holy water. For this ceremony the
priest, who was about to celebrate the Mass, came to the
entrance of the chancel, accompanied
by the deacon and subdeacon—if
there were any such
ministers; if not, by the clerks
and servers carrying the platter
of salt and the manual, and by
the <i>aquæbajularius</i> holding the
vat of water to be blessed.
From the earliest times of
English Christianity the people
had been taught to use this
water and salt mingled together
with the Church’s
prayers, that by it they might
be reminded of the purity of heart necessary to all God’s
servants, and that, by virtue of the power of God invoked
in the prayers upon the water, His providence might watch
over them and defend them from all danger of body and
soul. Pope St. Gregory the Great had told St. Mellitus to
bid our first apostle, St. Augustine, make use of the old
pagan temples, having first caused “holy water (to) be
blessed and sprinkled all over” them.</p>

<p>In the same way the English people were taught to make
use of the water thus solemnly blessed on the Sunday in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
their midst. As far back as the days of Archbishop Theodore,
as appears in Thorpe’s <i>Ancient Laws</i>, it was written:
“Let the people sprinkle their houses with hallowed water
as often as they wish.” And in the porch of each parochial
church a small niche contained some of the consecrated
water, with which those coming to God’s house signed themselves,
the while whispering a prayer that they may be
accepted as pure in the sight of the Most High.</p>

<p>On the Sunday, moreover, after the blessing was finished,
the priest and his assistants came to the foot of the altar,
which was sprinkled with newly blessed water. Then turning,
he, in the same way, sprinkled each of the assistants as
they passed before him, and, last of all, if there were no
procession, he passed down the church casting the water upon
each altar he came to, and upon the people gathered in the
nave. If there was a procession, as seems generally to have
been the case, the assistants and clerks, with the servers,
followed the celebrant singing the anthems proper for the
day. The parish processional cross was carried first, with
two servers bearing candles, and with the thurifer and the
clerk “water-bearer.” In the smaller churches, when the
weather permitted, no doubt the procession would wend its
way outside, and pass along, followed by the people, amidst
the graves of those former parishioners who had gone before,
and who were taking their long rest in God’s acre. It was
during this Sunday visit, in all probability, that the living
offered their prayers for their dead, and cast the blessed
water upon their graves. Some of the wills of the fifteenth
century show how this practice was prized. In one will, for
instance, a citizen of York leaves a bequest to three priests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
to say Masses for his soul, and asks that “each after his Mass
should proceed to his grave, say a <i>De profundis</i> over it, and
sprinkle it with holy water.” Another citizen of the same
city, and a merchant, provided for a priest to visit his grave
daily and to cast the blessed water upon it.</p>

<p>To return to the procession. On coming back to the
church, or, if there had been no procession, when the sprinkling
of the church had been finished, the clergy and assistants in
cathedrals, gathered round the celebrant in front of the great
rood at the entrance of the choir for the <i>bidding prayer</i>.
This was, in smaller parochial churches, however, given out
from the pulpit after the Gospel of the Mass, and will be
spoken of in connection with the Sunday sermon, to which
a special chapter must be devoted.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to follow the Sunday congregation of a
pre-Reformation church through the singing of the parochial
Mass. The church itself, as the bequests in the wills of the
fifteenth century and other documents show, will have been
gay with a profusion of candles burning on the rood beam,
on the altars, and before each picture or shrine or image,
whilst in many places the great “rowell,” or candle-wheel,
would have been lit up, and with its crown of candles have
added to the general appearance of festivity, which the people
of mediæval England loved so much to see in their churches.</p>

<p>At the end of the Mass a loaf of bread, called the “holy
loaf,” or “holy bread,” was brought into the chancel, and, after
being blessed by the priest, was cut into small pieces and
distributed to the people. Then all came up to the chancel
steps and received the morsel from the celebrant, whose
hands they kissed. This blessed bread signified the fraternal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
love that always ought to bind Christians together, and the
practice of distributing it at the principal Sunday Mass continued
until the religious changes in the reign of Edward IV.
That the custom should be restored to them was one of the
demands of the Devonshire insurgents in that reign. The
churchwardens’ accounts contain many references to this
pious practice: the purchase of baskets for the distribution
of the bread, for instance, is recorded at St. Michael’s,
Cornhill, St. Mary the Great, Cambridge, at Cratfield,
and elsewhere. At Bromley, in Surrey, the churchwardens
collected from the people the money to furnish the bread.
In 1523, for instance, they acknowledge a collection of 2<i>s.</i>
for this purpose, and double that amount the following year.
Evidently, however, the custom which still prevails in France,
of families taking it in turn to give the bread to be blessed,
was not unknown in England in pre-Reformation days. Dr.
Rock quotes from some churchwardens’ accounts of Stamford-in-the-Vale,
Berks, to show that the custom was revived in
Queen Mary’s days. A piece of land there, “called Gander’s,”
provided at least a portion of the expense.</p>

<p>“The whole value of the chargis,” says the document, “comyth

</div>

<p>The remainder of the Sunday, with the exception of the
time—from half an hour to three-quarters—spent in taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
part in the Evensong or Vespers, which were probably sung
about two or three o’clock in the afternoon, was devoted to
rest and reasonable recreation, about which something will be
said in a subsequent chapter. For the priest Sunday was the
day when by law he had to visit the aged, infirm, and sick
in his parish. “Let the priests,” says the Constitution of
Gilbert, Bishop of Chichester, in 1289, “see the sick every
Sunday and feast day, and let them visit them with diligence.
Let them take heed that they make no difficulty about
attending to the sick at whatever hour they may be asked
for.” This same order is repeated in the Constitutions for
the Province of York in 1518, more than two centuries
after.</p>

<p>From the earliest times work was prohibited on Sundays
and holy days. Lyndwood, in his gloss on the Constitution
of Archbishop Chicheley prohibiting on such days
“all servile work in any city or place of the Province of
Canterbury,” explains at some length the nature of the prohibition.
When the work was genuinely necessary, as might
be in the case of a barber, or a blacksmith, or a cook, then
it was excused by the necessity, and did not come under the
law. But where the work could be done on another day,
or could have been easily anticipated or postponed, then it
was prohibited by ecclesiastical law. This applied to the
fairs and markets, which were so often held on feast days,
and which the authorities in the fourteenth century were
so much concerned to suppress, and the prohibition affected
as well those who sold as those who bought at them. The
Constitution of John Thoresby, Archbishop of York in 1367,
was the first order against the growing practice of holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
markets and fairs on the Sundays, and the misuse of the
cemeteries in this respect. The following year Archbishop
Simon Langham sent out a general monition for the Province
of Canterbury, and a special prohibition against certain
abuses in the Isle of Sheppey, where, “for the noise of the
people, the solemnities of the Mass in the church” were
disturbed, and where, on account of the attraction of the
market, people were induced to neglect their duty of being
present at the Divine Service. The prohibition against
selling and purchasing, however, did not apply to the
ordinary necessaries of life, as bread, meat, etc., so long as
the sale or purchase did not interfere with the religious
obligations of the parties, and did not prevent them from
going to church.</p>

<p>In another place the same canonist states, as he says,
“briefly,” what kind of work was to be considered “servile,”
and as such was prohibited to the people in mediæval England.
This includes all mechanical, agricultural, and mercantile
work, as well as the holding of courts or legal inquiries
of every kind, unless “reasonable necessity or charity”
required that any such work should be undertaken. In the
cause of charity, however, it was held to be lawful on the
holy days to assist to till, etc., the lands of the really poor,
after all religious duties had been fulfilled. The obligation
of resting from servile work on the Sunday or festival
was reckoned from the Vesper hour on the Saturday, or
the eve.</p>

<p>The instruction given to the people as to servile work
was very clear and well understood. In <i>Dives and Pauper</i>
it is thus put:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Every deadly sin is servile work, and such servile work God
defendeth every day, but most on the Holy day. For he that doth
deadly sin on the Holy day he doth double sin, for he doth sin and
thereto he breaketh the Holy day against God’s precept. Also
servile work is called every bodily work done principally for lucre
and worldly winning, as buying, selling, sowing, mowing, reaping,
and all craft of worldly winning, also markets, fairs, sitting of
Justices and of Judges, shedding of blood and execution, of punishing
by law, and all works that should draw men from God’s service.
Nevertheless, if sowing, reaping, mowing, carting, and such other needful
works (are done) purely for alms, and only for heaven made, and
for need of them that they are done to on holy days, then are they
not servile works nor the holy day broken thereby. Nevertheless,
on Sundays and great feasts, such works should not be done, but
if great need compel men thereto and deeds of great charity.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then, after saying that certain tradesmen and merchants
are permitted the preparation of wares and foods that must be
ready on the Monday, the author of <i>Dives and Pauper</i> proceeds:
“Also messengers, pilgrims, and wayfarers that might
well rest without great harm are excused, so that they do their
duty to hear Matins and Mass, if they mown, for long abyding
in many journeys is costful and perilous.” Any tendency
to grow slack in the observance of the Sunday was noted,
and strictly repressed by the authorities. In one instance
a bishop directs the priest to put a stop to the shoemakers
in his parish working on the Lord’s day, as he has heard they
did; in another an inquiry is ordered upon a denunciation
being made against an individual; and in a third a parson
is directed to denounce a parishioner from the pulpit for
having been proved to have worked without reason on a
holy day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>Before concluding this brief sketch of the Sunday and
week-day in an English mediæval parish from the point of
view of religion, notice must be taken of one regular feature
of that life—the Angelus. The Angelus bell, the Ave bell,
or the Gabriel bell, as it was variously called in England,
probably grew out of the Curfew, which originally was a
civil notification of the time to extinguish all lights; but in
the thirteenth century it was turned into a universal religious
ceremony in honour of Our Lord’s Incarnation and of His
Blessed Mother. In 1347 Ralph de Salopia, Bishop of Bath
and Wells, desired the cathedral clergy to say, the first
thing in the morning and the last thing at night, five <i>Aves</i>
for all benefactors living or dead. Some few years before
that time, Pope John XXII. had urged the habit of saying
three <i>Aves</i> at Curfew time. The practice soon spread to
England, and grew as it spread, and Archbishop Arundel
of Canterbury, in 1399, at the earnest request of King
Henry IV., ordered the usage of saluting the Mother of
God the first thing in the early morning and the last thing
at night, to be universally adopted in the province—“at daybreak
and at the Curfew,” and the bell that was then rung
was called by our English ancestors the “Gabriel Bell,” in
memory of that archangel’s salutation of Our Blessed Lady.
By a fortunate chance we are able to know the actual time
at which this Angelus bell was rung, for a casual note in a
Bury St. Edmund’s book gives the times of the tolling in
that city as at 4 a.m. and 9 p.m. in summer, and 6 a.m. and
8 p.m. in the winter.</p>

<p>Of this religious ceremony a writer says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“In accordance with a practice of the Early Church at morning
and evening, the Angelus bell, as it was called,” pealed “forth from
every steeple and bell-turret in the Kingdom, and as the sound
floated through the surrounding neighbourhood, the monk in his
cell, the baron in his hall, the village maiden in her cottage, and
the labourer in the field, reverently knelt and recited the allotted
prayer in remembrance of Christ’s Incarnation for us.”</p>

<p class="ph3">CHURCH FESTIVALS</p>


<p>The round of Church festivals was followed with a
lively interest by the people of every English parish.
From Advent to Advent the sequence of ecclesiastical
feasts was calculated to bring before the minds of practical
Christians the great drama of the Redemption of mankind;
and the joyous participation of the people in the various
celebrations was outwardly marked by the decoration of
their churches for the greater solemnities with hangings and
banners, with garlands of flowers, and with the multitude of
lights which on those days were set burning before altars
and statues.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical year began always with <i>Advent</i>—the
time of preparation for the coming of our Lord into the
world, when the old-world yearning of the nations for
the promised Redeemer was ever brought prominently by
the Church before the Christian people in the words of the
liturgy, from the <i>Ad Te levavi</i>, “To Thee have I lifted up
mine eyes,” of the Introit for the first Sunday, to the <i>Hodie
scietis</i>, “Know ye to-day that the Lord will come, and will
bring you salvation,” of the Christmas Eve. In a fifteenth-century
English book of <i>Instructions for Parish Priests</i>, it
is said that fasting during Advent was counselled, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
not ordered by the Church. The Church of Rome kept this
practice of preparing strictly for the festival of Christmas,
and priests, in the opinion of the writer, ought to follow this
example. Lay people were free of any obligation, but those
who intended to receive Holy Communion on the Nativity
were to be strongly urged to prepare by this salutary fasting.
The festival of Christmas was celebrated with the customary
three Masses—the first at midnight, preceded by Matins; the
second in the early morning; and the third at the usual
time of nine or ten. In many places in the time of Christmas,
a religious play suitable to the season enlivened the
winter evenings, and impressed on the minds of the people
the chief incidents in the history of our Lord’s birth. The
coming of the Kings on the Epiphany was also a subject lending
itself to picturesque illustration, which never failed to delight
the simple-minded parish audience of pre-Reformation
days. At Great Yarmouth, year after year, the people kept
the <i>Feast of the Star</i>; and such entries occur in the accounts
as “for making a new Star,” “for leading the Star,” “for
a new balk-line to the Star, and ryving the same.” Manship,
in his <i>History</i> of that town, says that “in the chancel aisles
were performed those sacred dramas intended to give the
people a living representation of the leading occurrences
narrated in Holy Writ, and of the principal events in our
Lord’s life.”</p>

<p>On the feast of Holy Innocents, or, as it was called frequently,
“Childermas,” there was kept a feast which may
seem somewhat strange to our notions, but which our forefathers
evidently loved well. It was the festival of the boy-bishop,
attended by his youthful ministers. Sometimes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
celebration was associated with the name of St. Nicholas,
and was thus kept on December 6th, rather than on the 28th;
but the method of the festival was the same. Dr. Rock, in
<i>The Church of our Fathers</i>, has described this pageant for us.
In every cathedral, collegiate, and parish church the boys
of the place—and in those days every little boy either sang
or served about the altar at church—met together on the
eve of the feast, and chose of their number a “St. Nicholas
and his clerks.” This boy-bishop and his ministers then sang
the first Vespers of the Saint, and in the evening walked
all round the parish making collections for their feast. All
who could afford it asked them into their houses and made
them presents of various kinds. In 1299 Edward I., for
instance, attended Vespers in his chapel at Heton, near
Newcastle-on-Tyne, at which the “boy-bishop” and his
fellows sang, and he gave them 40s. for singing before him;
and the <i>Northumberland Household Book</i> tells us that “My
Lord useth and accustomyth to gyfe yerly, upon Saynt
Nicolas—even, if he kepe chapell for Saynt Nicolas, to the
mester of his children of his chapell for one of the childeren
of his chapell, yerely 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p>It was upon this feast that, in memory of the Holy
Innocents, some father of a family in the parish would make
an entertainment for his children, and invite those of his
neighbours to join in the festivities. In such a case, of
course, the “Nicholas and his clerks” sat in the most
honoured place. The <i>Golden Legend</i> relates a story illustrating
the practice: “A man, for the love of his sone that
wente to scole for to lerne, halowed every year the fest of
Saynt Nicholas moche solemnly. On a tyme it happed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
the fader had doo make redy the dyner, and called many
clerkes to this diner.”</p>

<p>It was, however, on Holy Innocents’ day that the boy-bishop,
chosen on the feast of St. Nicholas, played his part
in a set of pontificals provided for him. At St. Paul’s, at
York Minster, and at Lincoln, we find recorded in the inventories
pontificals provided for his use. In the parish
church of St. Mary-at-Hill, in London, the churchwardens
paid for “a myter for a bysshop at St. Nicholas tyde.” At
this parish church, too, there was a store of copes, a mitre,
and a crosier for the boy-bishop; whilst at St. Mary’s, Sandwich,
the inventory contains “a lytyll chasebyll for Seynt
Nicholas bysschop,” and at York there were “nine copes”
for the boy attendants.</p>

<p>On the feast of Holy Innocents the boy-bishop was
frequently expected to preach a sermon, which had been
written for him. One such, written for a boy in St. Paul’s
school by Erasmus, is still extant. Until Archbishop Peckham’s
day the “little Nicholas and his clerks” used to take
a conspicuous place in the services of the church during the
octave of the feast, but in 1279 that prelate decreed that
the celebration should be confined to the one day of the
feast only. That this feast was popular, and that our forefathers
delighted in coming to their parish churches to witness
their children associated in this ceremonial around God’s
altar, may be judged from the statute of Roger de Mortival,
Bishop of Sarum in 1319, in which he forbids too much
treating of the children, and orders that the crowd at the
procession are not to hustle or hinder the boys as they do
their ceremonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>Hardly had the festivals connected with Christmas been
celebrated, than on the second day of February the <i>Feast of
the Purification</i>, known as <i>Candlemas Day</i>, was kept. From
the earliest times our English forefathers gathered together
in their parish churches on that day, for the blessing of the
candles and for the procession with lighted tapers, as the
symbols of the burning love of their hearts for Christ, and
in memory of the presentation of our Blessed Lord in the
Temple. Ælfric, the Saxon homilist, speaks of the feast
in his days, and the celebration remained the same till the
change of religion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Be it known also to every one,” he says, “that it is appointed
in the ecclesiastical observances, that we on this day bear our lights
to church and let them there be blessed: and that we should go
afterwards with the light among God’s houses and sing the hymn
that is thereto appointed. Though some men cannot sing, they can,
nevertheless, bear the light in their hands; for on this day was
Christ the true light borne to the temple, Who redeemed us from
darkness, and bringeth us to the Eternal Light, who liveth and
ruleth for ever.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ash Wednesday.</span>—The great fast of Lent, which was
a time devoted to penance for sins, and in which sorrow for
offences was increased by the continual memory of Christ’s
suffering and death for mankind, was ushered in by what
was known as <i>Shrove-tide</i>. This was the week that followed
<i>Quinquagesima</i> Sunday, the Sunday before Ash Wednesday.
As its name imports, it was the time when Christians were
urged to prepare their souls for the weeks of Lenten penance
by confessing their sins to God through their parish priest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
or, as they said, shriving themselves. “Now is a clean and
holy tide drawing nigh,” said a homilist, “in which we should
make amends for our heedlessness; let, therefore, every
Christian man come unto his confessor, and confess his
secret guilt.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp75" id="i_169" style="max-width: 109.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_169.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On <i>Ash Wednesday</i> in each parish church, before the
celebration of Mass, ashes were blessed, and each man,
woman, and child came and knelt before their priest to
have them strewn upon their heads, whilst his words reminded
them that they “were dust, and unto dust they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
would return.” After the distribution of the ashes, according
to an ancient English custom, if there were another church
in the same district, all the people went to it in procession,
and, having made there “a stay,” or <i>statio</i>, for prayer, returned
to their own church for Mass. With Ash Wednesday began
the strict fast of Lent, which had to be kept on all days
except Sundays; and even then no meat was permitted. On
the week-days the fast was not allowed to be broken till
after Mass and Vespers had been said in the parish church;
that is, before eleven or twelve o’clock. The Anglo-Saxon
<i>Ecclesiastical Institutes</i> speaks of those days of Lent as “the
tithing-days of the year,” which all good Christians should
render to God most strictly. “Every Sunday at this holy
tide,” says the same authority, “people should go to housel,”
a practice which was not preserved in the later middle ages.
The time of Lent was also known as the “holy time,” and
unnecessary and distracting business was as far as possible
avoided. Thus, for instance, the assizes were prohibited
during the whole period.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lenten Curtain.</span>—From the evening before the
first Sunday of Lent till the Thursday before Easter, what
was known as the “Lenten curtain,” or “Lenten veil,” hung
down in all parish churches between the chancel and the
nave. It was one of the “ornaments” which the parishioners
were bound to provide, and the churchwardens’ accounts
contain many references to it, both as to its provision and
as to the expenses of erection. It was made of white stuff
or linen, and hid the sanctuary from the people, except at
the reading of the Gospel and until the <i>Orate Fratres</i>, when
it was pulled aside. It was also drawn back on all feast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
days kept during Lent. The order that the confessions of
women should be heard “outside the veil,” in the sight of
all but out of hearing, refers to the Lenten veil. “The veil,”
says the <i>Liber Festivalis</i>, “that all the Lent has been drawn
between the altar and the choir betokeneth the prophecy of
Christ’s Passion, which was hidden and unknown till these
days.” But in these three last days of Holy Week it “is
done away (with), and the altar openly schowed to all men;
for on these days Christ suffered openly His Passion.”</p>

<p>Upon the first Monday in Lent all the crucifixes and
images of every kind, both large and small, were covered
with white cloths; or in the case of those niches which had
their own wooden doors, these were closed till the eve of
Easter. The linen or silk coverings were worked or painted
with a red cross, and the “red cross” had its peculiar significance
in the ritual of the English Church. The procession
on each Sunday in Lent was not allowed to be headed by
the ordinary <i>Crux processionalis</i>, but a wooden cross painted
red, in reference to the shedding of our Lord’s blood upon
the cross in the throes of His crucifixion, was substituted
for it. That the practice had a special meaning to our forefathers
seems to be the case, since Sir Thomas More walked
to execution, as Cresacre More says, “carrying in his hands
a red cross.” Langland, too, in his vision makes “Conscience”
say that</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Palm Sunday.</span>—The dramatic ceremonies of Holy Week
commenced with those of Palm Sunday. “This week now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
begun,” says an old fifteenth-century writer, “is called <i>penosa</i>,
because people, in this more than in any other week, keep
their sins before their minds, and mortify themselves in their
sorrow.” From the earliest times, as Ælfric tells us, it was
the custom in England on this Sunday that “the priest
should bless palm-twigs and distribute them so blessed to
the people,” and that then the people should go forth in
procession with him, singing the “hymn which the Jewish
people sang before Christ when He was approaching to His
Passion.” The so-called “palms” in England were probably
willow, box, and yew, charges for which appear in the
churchwardens’ accounts. In fact, one sixteenth-century
authority states that the yew trees so frequently to be found
in the neighbourhood of churches were planted in the churchyards
of England to furnish the yew-branches which usually
served for palms on Palm Sunday.</p>

<p>Dr. Rock thus describes the procession and other ceremonies
in the first part of the service on this day—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In many parts of the country a large and splendidly ornamented
tent was set up at the furthermost end of the close or burial-ground,
and thither, early in service time, was carried by two priests, accompanied
with lights, a sort of beautiful shrine of open work, within
which hung the Blessed Sacrament, enclosed in a rich cup or pix.
The long-drawn procession, gay and gladsome with its palms and
flowers, went forth, and halted now and then, as it winded round the
outside of the church to make a station. While they were going from
the North side towards the East, and had just ended the Gospel read
at the first of these stations, the shrine with the Sacrament,” borne
by priests under a canopy, “surrounded with lights in lanterns and
streaming banners, and preceded by a silver cross and by a thurifer
with incense, was borne forward, so that they might meet it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
it were; and our Lord was hailed by the singers chanting <i>En rex
venit mansuetus</i>. Kneeling lowly down and kissing the ground, they
saluted the Sacrament again and again, in many appropriate sentences
out of Holy Writ; and the red cross withdrew from the
presence of the silver crucifix.”</p>
</div>

<p>The procession then moved forward in parish churches to
the churchyard cross, where it halted, and there, falling down,
all, priests and people, worshipped Him who had died on the
cross for the sins of men. Then palms and flowers were
strewn round about it, and after the Passion had been read,
palms were brought and the churchyard cross was wreathed
as for a victory, in memory of Christ’s triumph over death.</p>

<p>From the cross the procession now went to the closed
door of the church for the singing of the <i>Gloria laus</i>—the
joyous imitation of the hymns the Jews sung on that day
when bringing our Saviour to the gates of Jerusalem. When
this part of the ceremony was ended, the church doors flew
open, and the priests who bore the shrine with the Blessed
Sacrament, held their sacred burden aloft in the doorway, “so
that all who went in had to go under this shrine, and in this
way the procession came back into the church, each one
bowing his head in token of reverence and obedience” as he
passed beneath the Sacrament.</p>

<p>The fourth and last “station” of the Palm Sunday procession
was held before the great Rood, from which the large
curtain, which all Lent had hidden the figure of the crucified
Saviour, was now drawn aside. At the sight of the crucifix
the celebrant and his assistants, together with all the people,
knelt and saluted it thrice with the words <i>Ave Rex noster, fili
David, Redemptor</i>. A fifteenth-century preacher, giving only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
a brief instruction on this day, because, as he notes, of the
length of the service, says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Holy Church this day in a sollempne procession makes in mynd
of that procession of our Lord to Jerusalem.... And as they
songen and diden worship to Christ in ther procession, rythe so we
this day worchep the crosse in our procession, thries kneeling to the
cross in worchep, in ye mynde of Hym that was for us done on
the crosse, and we welcome Him with songe in the chirch as they
welcomed Him to the citie Jerusalem.”</p>
</div>

<p>The true inward meaning of this great act of worship
done to the cross at this time was carefully taught to the
people. The author of <i>Dives and Pauper</i> has the passage
which follows, about the worship of the Rood on Palm
Sunday—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Dives.</i>—On Palm Sunday at the procession the priest draweth
up the veil before the rode and falleth down to the ground with all
the people, and sayeth thrice thus: ‘<i>Ave Rex noster</i>’-‘Hail be
Thou our King,’ and so he worships the thing as King.</p>

<p>“<i>Pauper.</i>—<i>Absit!</i> God forbid! He speaks not to the image
that the carpenter hath made and the painter painted, unless the
priest be a fool; for the stock and stone was never King; but he
speaketh to Him that died upon the cross for us all—to Him that
is King of all things.”</p>
</div>

<p>For this and the other ceremonies of Holy Week in many
parishes additional help was, if possible, obtained by the
clergy and people, and the churchwardens’ accounts frequently
show items of expense under this head. In one case we have
the sum of 8<i>d.</i> charged for “the old friar who came to sing for
the parish.” At St. Michael’s, Cornhill, the wardens paid
for “two clerks for singing” at this time; and at St. Peter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
Cheap, in 1447, there is an entry: “Item—payde on Palme
Sundaye for bread and wine to the readers of the Passion,
3<i>d.</i>” This refers, of course, to the chanting of the Gospel
according to St. Matthew, which took place during the Mass,
that on this day followed the unveiling of the Rood.
Before evensong on Palm Sunday the great crucifix was
again covered with the veil, and it so remained hidden until
the morning service of Good Friday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tenebræ.</span>—“On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday you
shall come,” says a fourteenth-century writer, “to Matins,
which we call <i>tenebræ</i>.” At this service a triangular candlestick
with twenty-five candles was placed in the choir. This
candle-stand was called in England the “tenebræ,” or
Lenten “herse,” and it is so named in many church accounts.
It was one of the ornaments which had to be paid for by the
parish, and it was sometimes known as the “Judas” candle.</p>

<p>In a sermon intended to explain the meaning of the
peculiar ceremonies of “tenebræ,” the preacher says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“God men and wymine, as ye see theise thre days for to service
ye go in ye evontyde in darknesse. Wherfore hit is callyd with you
‘tenabulles;’ but holy churche calleth hit <i>tenebras</i>, that is to say,
‘derknesse.’ Than why this service is done in darkness holy fathers
wrytuth to us thre skylles.” Then, after giving these reasons, he
continues, “Wherefore to this service is no bell irongon, bot a
sownde makuth of tre, whereby uche criston man and woman is
enformede for to comon to this service withowtyn noyse makyng,

<p><span class="smcap">Maundy, or Sheer Thursday.</span>—On Thursday in
Holy Week was commemorated the Institution of the Blessed
Eucharist by our Lord in His last Supper. The <i>Liber Festivalis</i>
makes the following explanation of the feast, for the
benefit of those who ask for the reason of such things—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“First if men aske why <i>Schere</i> Thursday is so called, say y<sup>t</sup> in
holy churche it is called Our Lord’s Soper day. For that day he
soupud with hys disciple oponly.... Hit is also in English tong
‘Schere Thursday,’ for in owr elde fadur days men wold on y<sup>t</sup> day
makon scheron hem honest, and dode here hedes ond clypon here
berdes and poll here hedes, ond so makon hem honest agen Estur

non ease, but suffur penaunce, in mynde of Hym y<sup>t</sup> suffrud so harte

shall dodun his heres and clypponde his berde, and a prest schal
schave his crowne so that there schall no thynge bene betwene God
Almythy and hym.”</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Maundy.</i>—On this day in all cathedral churches, in
the greater parish churches, and even in some of the smaller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
ones, the feet of thirteen poor people were washed with great
solemnity, and they were fed and served at their meal by the
dignitaries of the place, in memory of our Lord’s act of
humility in washing the feet of His disciples. This
“Maundy” was kept also in England by kings and nobles,
and even by private individuals, who on this day entertained
Christ’s poor in their houses.</p>

<p><i>The Absolution.</i>—Thursday in Holy Week was also known
to our forefathers as “absolution day,” because, after tenebræ,
in the evening, in larger churches, the people knelt before
the penitentiary in acknowledgment of their repentance of
sin, and received from him a token of God’s acceptance by a
rod being placed on their heads. Sometimes this voluntary
humiliation and discipline was performed on Good Friday,
and the rods touched the hands of the penitent. It was to
this rite Sir Thomas More refers in his book against Tyndall,
where he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tyndale is as lothe, good, tender pernell, to take a lyttle
penaunce of the prieste, as the lady was to come any more to
dyspelying that wept even for tender heart twoo dayes after when she
talked of it, that the priest had on Good Friday with the dyspelyng
rodde beaten her hard on her lylye white hands.”</p>
</div>

<p>The church accounts sometimes refer to the purchase of
rods for this purpose by the wardens.</p>

<p><i>The Sepulchre.</i>—The service of Maundy Thursday morning
included the consecration of two hosts, besides that which
the celebrant received at the Communion of the Mass. At
the conclusion of the service these two hosts were carried to
some becoming place till the following day, when one was
used in the Mass of the Presanctified, and the other was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
placed in a pyx and put along with the cross, which had just
been kissed and venerated, into what was known as the
“Easter Sepulchre.” On the afternoon of Good Friday
it was customary for
people in the towns to
make visits to the various
churches to pray at these
sepulchres. There is no
expense more constantly
recorded in all the parochial
accounts than that
for the erection and taking
down of the Easter
Sepulchre. Generally, no
doubt, it was a more or
less elaborate, although
temporary, erection of
wood, hung over with
the most precious curtains
and hangings which
the church possessed,
some of which were even
frequently left for this
special purpose. Here
in this “chapel of repose” the Blessed Sacrament was placed
at the conclusion of the Mass of the Presanctified, and here
the priest and people watched and prayed before it till early
in the morning of Easter day.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">EASTER SEPULCHRE, ARNOLD, NOTTS</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are, however, in England some interesting instances
of permanent “tombs” being erected to serve as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
Easter Sepulchre. Some people in their wills left money
to have a structure for the “altar of repose,” worthy of its
purpose, built over the spot on which they themselves desired
to be buried.</p>

<p>After the morning service of Maundy Thursday, the high
altar, and then all the altars in the church, were stripped of
their ornaments and cloths and were left bare, in memory
of the way our Blessed Lord was stripped of His garments
before His crucifixion. In the evening of the same day all
the altars were washed with wine and blessed water, the
minister saying at each the prayer of the Saint to whom the
altar was dedicated; then he and all the clerks, having
devoutly kissed the stone slab, retired in silence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good Friday.</span>—The chief feature in the morning service
of Good Friday was undoubtedly the “adoration of the
Cross” and the ceremonial kissing of it, better known in
England as the “Creeping to the Cross.” The meaning of
this act of worship is set out in <i>Dives and Pauper</i> so clearly
that there can be no doubt as to what our forefathers intended
by it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Pauper.</i>—In the same manner lewd men should do their worship
before the thing, making his prayer before the thing and not to the
thing.</p>

<p>“<i>Dives.</i>—On the other hand, on Good Friday above all in holy
Church men creep to the church and worship the cross.</p>

<p>“<i>Pauper.</i>—That is so, but not as thou meanest: the cross that
we creep to and worship so highly that time is Christ himself that
died on the cross that day for our sins and our sake. For the shape
of man is a cross, and as He hung upon the rood He was a very
cross. He is that cross, as all doctors say, to whom we pray and
say, <i>Ave crux, spes unica</i>—‘Hail be thou Cross, our only hope,’ etc.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
And as Bede saith; for as much as Christ was most despised of
mankind on Good Fryday, therefore Holy Church hath ordeyned
that on the Good Fryday men should do Him that great high
worship that day, not to the crosse that the priest holdeth in his
hand, but to Hym that died for us all that day upon the crosse.”</p>
</div>

<p>Archbishop Simon Mepham (1327-1333) issued a special
Constitution as to the way in which this solemn day was to
be kept throughout England.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We order and ordain,” he says, “that this holy day of Good
Friday, on which our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ after many
stripes laid down His precious life on the Cross for the salvation
of men, according to the custom of the Church should be passed in
reading, silence, prayer and fasting with tearful sorrow.”</p>
</div>

<p>For which reason this Synod forbade all servile work on
this great day; the archbishop adding, however, that this
did not apply to the poor, and that the rich might show
their charity to the poor by aiding them in work upon their
land. The canonist Lyndwood points out, in commenting
on this provision, that by “silence” the archbishop probably
intends to prohibit all shouting or noise, all loud talking or
disputes, which might interfere with the solemnity of this
commemoration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Holy Saturday.</span>—The service of this day probably
began at a late hour, as, according to primitive custom, it
was the Office of a Vigil. The first act in the long Office
was the blessing of the new fire, which had previously been
struck by a steel out of flint. After a candle had been lit
at the new fire, the procession passed from outside the
western door, where this first portion of the ceremony had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
been held, into the church for the blessing of the <i>Paschal
Candle</i>. The preparation of this symbol of “the risen Lord,”
with the five glorified grains of incense, to remind all of
His five sacred wounds, was one of the yearly parochial
works. The charges for it are to be found in every book
of church accounts: money was collected for the purpose,
people gave presents towards it, and in some places—at
St. Dunstan’s, Canterbury, for instance—goods in kind were
placed in the hands of the wardens, in order that the
hiring-out of them might pay for the annual “paschal.”
To this practice of having their annual “paschal,” the people
clung somewhat tenaciously on the change of religion; and
as late as 1586, at Great Yarmouth, charges were made
by the churchwardens for taking down and putting up “the
Paschal.”</p>

<p>The <i>Paschal</i>, apparently, was commonly a lofty construction:
a tall thick piece of wood painted to represent a candle,
and ornamented, rested in the socket of the candlestick, and
on the top of this, at a great height, was the real candle.
For some reason not known, the wooden part was called by
our English ancestors the “Judas of the Paschal.” On this
day also, in every parish church, the font was hallowed with
impressive and symbolic ceremonies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Easter Day.</span>—“On this day,” says an English fourteenth-century
sermon book—“on this day all the people
receive the Holy Communion.” This was apparently the
universal custom; and although in preparation for this Easter
duty the parishioners were advised to go to their parish
priest at the beginning of Lent, there are indications that
during the last days of Holy Week there was sometimes a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
press of penitents. At St. Mary’s, Dover, for example, in
1538 and 1539, the churchwardens enter in their expenses,
“Item—paid to two priests at Easter to help shrive—2<i>s.</i>”
And in 1540 the entry runs, “Item—paid to three priests to
help shrive and to minister on Maunday Thursday, Easter
even, and Easter day, 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p>Early in the morning of Easter, at the first streak of
dawn, the people hastened to the church to be present when
the Blessed Sacrament was brought by the priests from the
sepulchre to the usual place where it hung over the altar.
Sometimes the image of our Lord, which had been placed
with it in the figurative tomb of the Easter sepulchre, was
made movable, and on Easter day was placed on the altar
in a standing position. This probably was the case at
St. Mary’s, Cambridge, where in 1537 the churchwardens
paid “for mending of the Vice for the Resurrection.” Generally,
however, the crucifix was brought out of the place of
repose and taken to some side altar, and there once more,
as on Good Friday, all clergy and people knelt to honour it
and kiss it. This was the practice in many large churches,
and a description of the “Resurrection figure” is given in
the <i>Rites of Durham</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There was in the Abbye church of Duresme,” says the writer,
“a very solemn service uppon Easter day, between three and four
of the cloche in the morninge in honour of the Resurrection, where
two of the oldest monkes came to the sepulchre, being sett upp
upon Good Friday after the Passion, all covered with red velvett
and embrodered with gold, and then did sence it, either monke with
a pair of silver sencers sitting on their knees before the Sepulchre.
Then they both rising came to the sepulchre, out of the which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
with great devotion and reverence, they tooke a marvelous beautiful
image of our Saviour, representing the Resurrection, with a cross
in his hand, in the breast whereof was enclosed in bright christall
the Holy Sacrament of the Altar, through the which christall the
Blessed Host was conspicuous to the beholders. Then, after the
elevation of the said picture, carryed by the said two monkes uppon
a faire velvett cushion all embrodered, singinge the anthem of
<i>Christus resurgens</i>, they brought it to the high altar, settinge that
on the midst thereof, whereon it stood, the two monkes kneelinge
on their knees before the altar and senceing it, all the time that the
rest of the whole quire was in singinge the aforesaid anthem of
<i>Christus resurgens</i>. The which anthem being ended, the two monkes
took up the cushions and the picture from the altar, supportinge
it betwixt them, proceeding in procession from the high altar to the
South quire door, where there was four antient gentlemen belonginge
to the prior, appointed to attend their cominge, holding up a
moste rich canopye of purple velvett, tacked round about with redd
silk and gold fringe; and at every corner did stand one of these
gentlemen to beare it over the said image, with the Holy Sacrament
carried by two monkes round about the church, the whole quire
waiting uppon it with goodly torches and great store of other lights
till they came to the high altar againe, whereon they did place the
said image, there to remaine untill the Ascension day.”</p>
</div>

<p>An English Easter custom is referred to in more than
one book of sermons.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Fryndys,” says one preacher, “you schall understonde that hyt
ys a custome in plasys of worschyp, and in many other dyvers

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>And another preacher adds the moral—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Shewing example to all men and women that they should in
like wise clense the house of their soules.”</p>
</div>

<p>Langland gives us a slight sketch of an Easter morning
in England as he knew it in the fourteenth century.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rogation Days.</span>—During the entire week of Easter all
work not actually necessary was ordered to be laid aside, that
the people might have time for spiritual rejoicing. During
this time also, in most of the larger churches, after Evensong,
a procession with all the ministers vested in albs was formed
to the newly hallowed font, which, wreathed with flowers and
evergreens, was censed by the parish priest, and a “station”
for prayer was held at that spot.</p>

<p>On the three days before the feast of our Lord’s Ascension,
the ancient practice of going in procession singing the
litany of the Saints was kept up in every church, unless it
was one of the churches in a cathedral city, for in that case
the various parishes had to attend at the Mother church and
join together in one procession. These “rogations,” as they
were called, passed out of the church precincts, and wound
their way about streets or country roads of the parish, unless
bad weather confined them to the church itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Gode men,” says the <i>Liber Festivalis</i>, “theis thre dayes suying,
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, ye schall faston and com to
chyrche, husbond and wyfe and servaunde, for alle we be syners
and neduth to have mercy of God.... So holy Chyrch ordaineth
yt none schall excuson hym from theise processions yt may godely
ben there.”</p>
</div>

<p>The celebrated Richard FitzRalph, Archbishop of Armagh,
in 1346, when Dean of Lichfield, preached to the people at
St. Nicholas’ Chapel on the meaning and obligation of these
days of intercession, or rogation, and explained why men
prayed to the Saints, and why they sang their <i>Miserere</i> to
God. He also told the people why the cross went at the
head of the procession, and why the image of a dragon with
its tail out was carried the two first days before the procession
and the third day without its tail after the procession.
It is to those standards that the Sarum processional refers
in regard to these litanies, and to the same are to be referred
the items to be found in church accounts, such as those of
Salisbury, where in 1462 boys are paid “to carry the poles
and standards on Rogation days.”</p>

<p>The rest of the Christian year, with its round of feasts,
does not here require to be specially noted. The celebration
of one differed from that of another merely in the degree
of splendour with which the people decked their churches
and brought forth their precious vestments. At Whitsuntide
and Corpus Christi day; on Assumption and on All
Hallows, as well as on its own dedication day, each church
endeavoured to outdo its neighbour by the splendour of its
services. In the processions of Corpus Christi day, not
unfrequently several churches united their forces together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
and made a brave show in honour of the most Blessed Sacrament
with their various processional crosses and banners,
torches and thuribles, not to speak of the amalgamated choirs
and the throng of devout worshippers who accompanied the
Sacred Host in a triumphant progress through the streets
of our English cities, or along the roads and lanes of rural
England.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE SACRAMENTS</p>


<p>This account of parochial life in pre-Reformation
England requires some brief description of the Sacramental
system, which had its effect on every soul
in the district. From the time of his baptism as a child
of the Church, till his body was laid to rest in its tomb,
each parishioner was the constant recipient of some one of
those mysterious rites, by which, as he was taught by the
Church and as he believed, God’s grace was received into
his soul to enable him to lead the life of a good Christian.
In the administration of these Sacraments, nothing is more
clear in the teaching of the Church of the Middle Ages than
that there was to be no question of money. They—the
Sacraments—were spiritual things, and to sell them for fees
would be plain simony, which was prohibited by every law
of God and man. If the administrator was permitted to
take an offering, it was only with the plain understanding
that the payment was made in regard to the service rendered,
for which the recipient desired to make some return; and
that the Sacrament should be given without the fee. In
the case of such a Sacrament as Penance, for example,
where the acceptance of a fee or offering might lead to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
misunderstanding of the judicial character of the rite, and so
bring it into contempt, the reception of money was altogether
prohibited by the ecclesiastical authorities, and any such
abuse was sternly repressed. Thus, to take an example,
in the acts of the Synod of Ely in 1364, the bishop, Simon
Langham, says, “We have heard, and greatly grieve to have
done so, that some priests exact money from the laity for
the administration of penance or other Sacraments, and that
some, for the sake of filthy lucre, impose penances” which
bring in money to them. “These we altogether prohibit.”</p>

<p>The Sacraments, according to the teaching of the Church,
which every one who pretended to be a practical Christian
was bound to receive, were Baptism, Confirmation, Penance,
Holy Eucharist, Extreme Unction, and in the case of those
desiring to marry, Matrimony. Something may, therefore,
usefully be said about each of these.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baptism.</span>—“To those coming into the <i>mare magnum</i> of
this world,” says the legate Othobono, “Baptism must be
regarded as the first plank of safety in this sea of many
shipwrecks to support us to the port of salvation.” It is, he
continues, the gate through which all have to enter to enjoy
the grace of the other Sacraments, and for this reason “any
error in regard to it is most dangerous,” and the possibility of
any child dying without receiving the saving waters is to be
zealously guarded against. Because of the priceless efficacy
of the Sacrament, every parish priest was warned to teach
his people in the vernacular the form of properly administering
it, in case of need when a priest could not be had. On
this matter also the Archdeacon in the time of his visitation
of a parish was to inquire diligently whether these instructions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
had been given, and whether the parishioners generally knew
how to baptize in case of need.</p>

<p>The importance which the Church attached to this Sacrament
is well illustrated by a Constitution of St. Edmund
of Canterbury, which orders that when the expectation of
childbirth becomes imminent, all parents should be warned
to prepare a vessel and water to be ready at hand, in case
some sudden need should require the administration of
baptism.</p>

<p>Ordinarily speaking, there can be no doubt that the old
English practice was that every child should, if possible, be
baptized in the parish church on the day of birth. In the
ancient “proofs of age,” this practice is evident; one example
will be sufficient. In 1360 it was requisite to prove
the age of John, son and heir of Adam de Welle, and the
first witness who was called, said that “he knew that he
was born on the eve of St. Bartholomew the Apostle, because
he was with his master who stood god-parent to the child
on that day, which was Sunday 21 years ago.” Another
witness adds, that it was in the evening that the baptism
took place; and another that it was performed by John de
Scrubby, the chaplain.</p>

<p>There was, however, an exception. There were two days
for public baptism in the church, namely, Holy Saturday
and the Saturday before Pentecost, on which days the font
in every parish church was solemnly blessed. Apparently
among English mothers in the thirteenth century, this day
was regarded as unlucky, and was avoided by them as far
as possible for the baptism of their children, a superstition
that the two legates Otho and Othobono endeavoured to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
eradicate. It became consequently in England the practice,
if children were born within eight days of either of these
two vigils of Easter or Pentecost, that their baptism should
be administered after the blessing of the font, if there were
no danger in the delay. In the case of the baptism being
held over, however, halfway between the day of birth and
the day of baptism, the child was to have all the accompanying
rites administered except only the actual baptism.</p>

<p>One of the demands of the Devon “rebels” in the time
of the religious changes in Edward VI.’s reign had reference
to this question of baptism. “We will,” it ran, “that our
curates shall minister the Sacrament of Baptism at all times,
as well as in the week-day as on the holy-day.” To this
Cranmer, in his reply, says, “Every Easter and Whitsuneven,
until this time, the fonts were hallowed in every church
and many collects and other prayers were read for them
that were baptized. But alas! in vain, and as it were a
mocking with God; for at those times, except it were by
chance, none were baptized, but all were baptized before.”</p>

<p>The offering for the administration of baptism was strictly
voluntary. Whenever any difficulty arose between the parson
and his people on this matter, the bishop always took the
opportunity of laying down as the common law of the
Church that nothing could be exacted. Bishop Grandisson,
for instance, in 1355, in a case at Moreton Hampstead,
declared “that no priest could deny, or presume to deny,
any Sacrament to his parishioners by demanding money,
but that he might afterwards take what the people chose
to offer him.”</p>

</figure>

<p>The reverence with which our forefathers regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
whatever had been used for any sacred purpose is illustrated
in a matter connected with this Sacrament. Bishop Quevil,
in the Synod of Exeter in 1287, states that when in case
of necessity a child had been baptized in its own home, the
vessel that had been used should either be destroyed by fire
or given to the church to be used for ecclesiastical purposes;
and that the water should either be thrown on the fire or
taken to the church and poured down the “sacrarium.”

<p>Bishop Quevil, in the same Synod, also states the law of
the Church as to god-parents. For a boy, two men and one
woman were permissible; and similarly for a girl, two women
and one man. All others could only be regarded as witnesses,
and did not incur the bond of spiritual relationship as true
god-parents and their god-children did.</p>

<p>Before passing on, a few words must be said as to the
Font. According to the Constitutions of the English Church,
it was to be made of stone, and to be covered. It was on
no account to be used for any other purpose, even ecclesiastical.
For this reason, like the Holy Oils, it was to be
kept under lock and key. It was the privilege of a parochial
church alone to have a font, and the construction of one,
even in a Chapel of Ease, required the leave not only of the
bishop, but also of the rector of the parish. Thus, to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
an instance, about the middle of the fourteenth century Lord
Beauchamp desired to have a font in his chapel at Beauchamp.
The bishop gave his consent, but on condition that
the approval of the rector was first obtained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Churching of Women.</span>—Immediately connected with
the question of baptism is that old Catholic practice of the
churching of women. The rite was probably suggested by
the prescriptions of the law in Leviticus, and it was used
in the Greek as well as in the Latin Church. The priest
leads the woman into the church, saying, “Come into the
temple of God. Adore the Son of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
who has given thee fruitfulness in childbearing.” For churchings,
as for marriages and burials, the general fee was
supposed to be 1<i>d.</i>; but most people who could afford it
made a larger offering. The fee for churching is specially
named by Bishop Grandisson amongst those which a parson
should not demand, but which all who could, ought to give
willingly. Amongst the goods of St. Mary the Great,
Cambridge, in the churchwardens’ accounts is one: “Item.
A clothe of tappestry werk for chirching of wifes, lyned with
canvas, <i>in ecclesia</i>.” This, no doubt, would be a carpet upon
which the woman knelt before the altar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Confirmation</span> was, as Myrc says, “in lewde mennes
menynge is i-called the bys(h)opynge,” because it is and can
be given only by bishops. Strong pressure was brought to
bear upon the clergy to see that all were rightly confirmed,
and Archbishop Peckham, in 1280, forbade “any one to be
admitted to the Sacrament of our Lord’s body and blood
unless he had been confirmed, except when in danger of
death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>Bishop Woodlock of Winchester, in 1308, has a special
Instruction on the need of this Sacrament. Because he says,
“our adversary the devil, wishing to have us as companions
in his perdition, attacks with all his powers those who are
baptized; our watchful Mother the Church has added the
Sacrament of Confirmation, that by the strength received in
it every Christian may resist with greater force our hostile
enemy.” Parents are consequently to be warned to have
their children confirmed as soon as possible. If they are
not confirmed before they are three years old, unless there
has been no opportunity, the parents are to be made to fast
one day on bread and water in punishment of their negligence.
Moreover, since the Sacrament may not be given twice,
parents are to be bound to acquaint their children, when
they grow up, of the fact of their Confirmation. Priests are
also to instruct their people as to the law that through Confirmation
there arises a spiritual relationship, as in Baptism,
between the god-parents and the children and their parents.</p>

</figure>

<p>The Synod of Oxford laid it down as the law, that any
adult, when about to be confirmed, must first go to receive
the Sacrament of Penance from his own parish priest and
fast on the day of his Confirmation till after its reception.
Priests were required, also, to instruct their people frequently
on the need of getting their children confirmed as soon as
possible after they were baptized. This the canonist Lyndwood
considers would mean within six months or so. The
Synod likewise warned parents not to wait for the bishop to
come to their own parish, but to take their children to any
neighbouring place, where they might have heard that the
bishop was to be found. And any parish within seven miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
was for this purpose to be considered “a neighbouring
place.” In Bishop Grandisson’s Register there is an example
of his giving confirmation, at St. Buryan’s, in 1336, to
“children almost without number (<i>quasi innumerabiles</i>) from
the parish and the district round about.”</p>

<p>The honour and respect shown to the Chrism, which was
used by the bishop at Confirmation, is manifested by the
“old silk cloth” and “a clothe of syndale” used to carry
the Chrismatory at St. Mary the Great, Cambridge. The
Chrism was also bound to be renewed every year, the old
being burnt and a new stock procured from what was consecrated
on Maundy Thursday, in every cathedral church.
Moreover, when presenting a child for Confirmation, the
parents had to bring with them a linen band, or napkin, to bind
round its head after Confirmation, and cover the place where
it had been anointed. This band, called <i>Fascia</i>, or “Chrism
cloth,” was, according to various directions, to be left on the
head of the child three, seven, or eight days, when the lately
confirmed child was to be taken to the church by its parents,
and there have its forehead washed by the priest over the
font. The <i>fasciæ ligaturæ</i>, or “Chrism cloths,” were then to
be either burnt or left to the use of the church. Myrc, in
his <i>Instructions</i>, thus gives the usage—</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>
<p>Finally, the greatest care was taken not only to see that
all Christians should receive the Sacrament of Confirmation,
but that there should be no doubt as to its valid reception.
An instance of this is to be found in Bishop Brantyngham’s
Register. In 1382, some unknown person, calling himself
a bishop, went about the diocese of Exeter giving the tonsure,
and confirming children, and in other ways, as the bishop
says, “putting his sickle into other men’s harvest.” Under
these circumstances, the parents of all children presented
for confirmation to this unknown person were to be warned
from every parish pulpit to come and give evidence, in order
that it might be determined what should be done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Penance.</span>—The Sacrament of Penance, or, in other words,
“Confession,” was obligatory on all at least once a year. The
obligation, however, was obviously not considered the full
measure of duty for those who desired to lead good Christian
lives. Bishop Brunton, of Rochester, in a sermon preached
about the year 1388 on the first Sunday of Lent, whilst
laying down the law of Confession at the beginning of Lent,
strongly urges upon his audience the utility of frequently
approaching that Sacrament, but reminds them that a mere
formal Confession without a firm purpose of amendment is
worse than useless.</p>

<p>In the Synod of Exeter, in 1287, parish priests are
charged “to warn their parishioners, and frequently to
exhort them in their sermons, to come to Confession to
their own priest thrice in the year—at Christmas, Easter,
and Pentecost, or at the very least at the beginning of
Lent.” The same synodal instruction warns the parish
priests, moreover, to grant permission generously and freely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
to any one wishing to confess to some other priest, and
it adds, “that if any one shall not have confessed himself
and communicated once in the year, he shall be prohibited
coming to the church, and when dead be refused ecclesiastical
burial.”</p>

<p>All, rich and poor, noble and simple, on coming to
the Sacrament of Penance, were treated alike. An old
fifteenth-century book of <i>Instructions</i> says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Every body that shall be confessed, be he never so hye degree
or estate, ought to shew loweness in herte, lowenes in speche and
lowenes in body for that tyme to hym that shall hear hym; and
or he begynne to shew what lyeth in hys conscience, fyrste at hys
beginnyng he shall say, <i>Benedicite</i>: and afturwards hys confessor
hath answered <i>Dominus</i>. Sume than, whych be lettered, seyn here
<i>Confiteor</i> til they come to <i>Mea culpa</i>: sume seyn no ferthere, but
to <i>Quia peccavi nimis</i>; some seyn no <i>Confiteor</i> in latin till at the
last end. Of these maner begynnings it is lytyl charge, for the
substance of Confession is in opyn declaration and schewyng of
ye synnes, in whyche a mannus conscience demyth hym gulty
agenst God. In thys declaration be manye formes of shewyng,
for some scheme and divyde here confession in thought, speche
and dede, and in thys forme sume can specyfye here synnes, and
namely in cotydian confession, as when a man is confessed ofte;
oythes as every day or every othur day or onus in sevene nyght.
Also sume schewe and here confession by declaration of ye fyve
wyttes, and all may be well as in such cotydyan confession. Also
sume, and the most parte lettyred and unletteryd, schewe openly
her synnes be confession of ye sevene dedly synnes, and thane
they schewe what they have offendyd God agenste Hys precepts,
and then in mysdyspendyng of here fyve wyttes, and thanne in not
fulfyllyng ye seven dedus of mercy. And so, whanne they have
specyfyed what comyth to here mynde, then yn ye ende, they yelde<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
them cowpable generally to God and putte hem in Hys mercy,
askyng lowly penaunce for her synnnes and absolution of here
confessor in the name of holy church.”</p>
</div>

<p>The instructions, given by the Canons of the English
Church, as to the method to be followed by priests in
hearing confessions, are simple and to the point. They
are to remember that they are doctors for the cure of
spiritual evils, and to be ever ready “to pour oil and
wine” into the wounds of their penitents. They are to
bear in mind the proverb, that “what may cure the eye
need not cure the heel,” and are to apply the proper
remedy fitting to each disease. They are to be patient,
and “to hear what any one may have to say, bearing with
them in the spirit of mildness, and not exasperating them
by word or look.” They are “not to let their eyes wander
hither and thither, but keep them cast downwards, not
looking into the face of the penitent,” unless it be to gauge
the sincerity of his sorrow, which is often reflected most
of all in the countenance. Women are to be confessed
in the open church, and outside the (lenten) veil, not so
as to be heard by others but to be seen by them.</p>

<p>The place where confessions might be heard was settled
in the Constitutions of Archbishop Walter Reynold, in 1322.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Let the priest,” it is said, “choose for himself a common place
for hearing confessions, where he may be seen generally by all in
the church; and do not let him hear any one, and especially any
woman, in a private place, except in great necessity and because
of some infirmity of the penitent.”</p>
</div>

<p>Myrc, in his <i>Instructions</i>, says that in Confession the
priest is to</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Teche hym to knele downe on hys kne,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And here hys schryfte wyth mylde mod.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The place usually chosen by the priest to hear the confessions
of his people was apparently at the opening of
the chancel, or at a bench end near that part of the nave.
In some of the churchwardens’ accounts there is mention
of a special seat or bench, called the “shryving stool,”
“the shriving pew,” “the shriving place;” whilst at St. Mary
the Great, Cambridge, there appears to have been a special
erection for Lent time, as there is an entry of expense for
“six irons pertaining to the shryving stole for lenton,” which
suggests that these iron rods were to support some sort of a
screen round about the place of confession. Perhaps, however,
it may have been for an extra confessor, since, as already
related, in one place it is said that the parish paid for three
extra priests “to shreve” in Holy Week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Holy Eucharist.</span>—All adults of every parish
were bound to receive the Holy Communion at least once
a year under pain of being considered outside the benefits
and privileges of Holy Church and of being refused Christian
burial, if they were to die without having made their peace.
Besides the Easter precept, all were strongly urged to
approach the Holy Eucharist more frequently, and especially
at Christmas and Easter, and, as has been already pointed
out, there is some evidence to show that, in point of fact,
lay people did communicate more frequently, and especially
on the Sundays of Lent.</p>

<p>At Easter and other times of general Communion the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
laity, after their reception of the Sacrament, were given
a drink of wine and water from a chalice. The clergy were,
however, directed to explain carefully to the people that this
was not part of the Sacrament. They were to impress upon
them the fact that they really received the Body and Blood
of our Lord under the one form of bread, and that this cup
of wine and water was given merely to enable them to swallow
the host more securely and easily after their fast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Extreme Unction.</span>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This Sacrament,” says the Synod of Exeter, “is to be considered
as health giving to both body and soul ... wherefore it
is not the least of the Sacraments, and parish priests, when required,
should show themselves ever ready to visit the sick, and to administer
it to such as ask, without asking or expecting any payment or reward.</p>

<p>“We further order that, avoiding all negligence, parish priests
shall be watchful and careful in the care committed to them, and
that without reasonable cause they never sleep out of their parishes.
And further that in case they do ever so, they procure some fitting
substitute, who knows how to do everything which the cure of souls
requires.”</p>
</div>

<p>If by the fault, negligence, or absence of his priest any
one, old or young, shall die without Baptism, Confession,
Holy Communion, or Extreme Unction, the priest convicted
of this is to be forthwith suspended from the exercise of
his ecclesiastical functions, and this suspension is not to
be relaxed until he has done fitting penance “for so grave
a crime.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">SACRAMENT OF EXTREME UNCTION</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="smcap">Visitation of the Sick.</span>—The subject of <i>Extreme
Unction</i>, “the Sacrament of the sick,” to be given in danger
of death through sickness, raises the question of the visitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
of the sick in a mediæval parish. The order that all parish
priests should visit the sick of their district every Sunday
has already been noticed. It was, moreover, a positive law
of the Church, that every priest should go at once on being
called to a sick person, no matter what time of the day
or night the summons might come. Priests were ordered
also to impress upon all doctors the need of urging sick
people and their friends to send immediately for the priest
in all cases of serious illnesses. Priests, however, were not
to wait to be called, but directly they heard that any of
their people were unwell they were warned to go at once
to them.</p>

<p>A chance story, used to enliven a fifteenth-century
sermon, illustrates the readiness of priests to go to the
sick whenever they were summoned.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I read,” says the preacher, “in Devonshire, besides Axbridge
dwelt a holy vicar, and had in his parish a sick woman that lay
all at the death, half a myle from him in a town. The which woman
at midnight sent after this vicar to come and give her her rites.
Then this vicar with all haste that he might he rose and rode to
the church and took God’s body in a box of ivory,” etc.</p>
</div>

<p>Archbishop Peckham legislated for the mode of carrying
the Blessed Sacrament to the sick, or rather he codified
and made obligatory the usual practice. The parish priest
was to be vested in surplice and stole, and accompanied
by another priest, or at least by a clerk. He was to carry
the Blessed Sacrament in both hands before his breast,
covered by a veil, and was to be preceded by a server
carrying a light in a lantern, and ringing a hand bell, to
give notice to the people that “the King of Glory under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
the veil of bread” was being borne through their midst,
in order that they might kneel or otherwise adore Him.</p>

<p>If the case was so urgent, that there was no time for the
priest to secure a clerk to carry the light and bell, Lyndwood
notes that the practice was for the priest to hang the lamp
and bell upon one of his arms. This he would also do in
large parishes, where sick people had to be visited at a
distance and on horseback. In this case the lamp and bell
would be hung round the horse’s neck.</p>

<p>On the return to the church, should the Blessed Sacrament
have been consumed, the light was to be extinguished
and the bell silenced, so that the people might understand,
and not, in this case, kneel as the priest passed along.
Lyndwood adds that the people should be told to follow
the Sacrament with “bowed head, devotion of heart, and
uplifted hands.” They were to be taught also to use a set
form of prayer as the priest passed along, such as the
following: “Hail! Light of the world, Word of the Father,
true Victim, Living Flesh, true God and true Man. Hail
flesh of Christ, which has suffered for me! Oh, flesh of
Christ, let Thy blood wash my soul!” The great canonist
says that he himself on these occasions was accustomed to
make use of the well-known “<i>Ave verum Corpus, natum ex
Maria Virgine</i>,” etc.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="i_205" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_205.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">HEARSE AND PALL, FIFTEENTH CENTURY. CANTORS AT LECTERN</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The bell and light, or lights, for the visitation of the sick,
were to be found by the parish, and the churchwardens’
accounts consistently record expenses to procure and maintain
these lights. In some places, apparently, the people
found two such lanterns instead of the one which the law
obliged them to furnish. In the Archdeacon’s visitations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
also, there were set inquiries to see that the parish did its
duty in this matter. In one such examination there are
references to the necessary “cyphus pro infirmis,” which is
stated to be good, bad, or wanting altogether. What this
may have been is not quite clear; but probably it was the
dish in which the priest purified his fingers, after having
communicated the sick person. Myrc gives a rhyming
summary of what a priest should know about visiting the
sick. He is to go fast when called; he is to take a clean
surplice and a stole, “and pul thy hod over thy syght;” in
case of death being imminent, he is not to make the sick
man confess all his sins, but merely charge him to ask God’s
mercy with humble heart. If the sick man cannot speak,
but shows by signs that he wishes for the Sacraments—“Nertheless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
thou schalt hym Soyle, and give hym hosul and
holy oyle.”</p>

<p>The bishops watched carefully to see that no laxity
should creep into the mode of giving the Viaticum to the
sick. Bishop Grandisson, in 1335, issued a special mandate
to the priests of his diocese on the matter, as he had heard
that some carelessness had been noticed. He reminds them
that the Provincial Constitutions were clear in their prescriptions
that all were to wear a surplice and stole, unless
the weather were bad, and then these might be carried and
put on before the room of the sick man was entered. They
must always have the light borne before them, however, and
the bell was to be rung to call the attention of the people
generally to the passing of the Sacrament, and thus enable
them to make their adoration.</p>

<p>According to most books of instruction on the duties of
priests, before the sick man was anointed or received the
holy Viaticum, the parson was to put to him what were
known as “the seven interrogations.” He was to be asked:
(1) if he believed the articles of the faith and the Holy
Scriptures; (2) whether he recognized that he had offended
God Almighty; (3) whether he was sorry for his sins;
(4) whether he desired to amend, and if God gave him more
time, by His grace he would do so; (5) whether he forgave
all his enemies; (6) whether he would make all satisfaction;
(7) “Belevest thowe fully that Criste dyed for the, and that
thow may never be saved but by the merite of Cristes
passione, and thonne thonkest therof God with thyne harte
as moche as thowe mayest? He answerethe, Yee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Thanne let the curat desire the sick persone to saye <i>In manus
tuas &amp;cetera</i> with a good stedfast mynde and yf that he canne.
And yef he cannot, let the curate saye it for hym. And who so
ever may verely of very good conscience and trowthe without any
faynyng, answere ‘yee,’ to all the articles and poyntes afore rehersed,
he shalle live ever in hevyne with Alle myghtie God and with his
holy cumpany, wherunto Ihesus brynge bothe youe and me. Amen.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Marriage.</span>—So far in this chapter the Sacraments which
every parishioner had to receive at one time or other have
been briefly treated. It remains to speak of the Sacrament
of Matrimony, which, though not absolutely general, yet
commonly affected most people in every parish. “Marriage,”
says Bishop Quevil, in the Synod of Exeter—“marriage
should be celebrated with great discretion and reverence, in
proper places and at proper times, with all modesty and
mature consideration; it should be celebrated not in taverns
nor during feastings and drinkings, nor in secret and suspect
places.” That a matter of this importance should be rightly
done, the Synod lays down the law of the Catholic Church
on the point; no espousal or marriage was to be held valid
unless the contract was made in the presence of the parish
priest and three witnesses. For, although the contract of the
parties was the essential factor in marriage, still, “without
the authority of the Church, by the judgment of which
the contract had to be approved, marriages are not to be
contracted.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The first matter to be attended to in arranging for a
marriage in any parochial church was, as now, the publication
of the banns in the church on three successive Sundays or
feast days. This was to secure the proof of the freedom of
the parties to marry. In a book of instructions for parish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
priests, written about 1426, some interesting information is
given as to marriage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The seventh Sacrament is wedlock,” it says, “before the which
Sacrament the banes in holy church shal be thryes asked on thre
solempne dayes—a werk day or two between, at the lest: eche day
on this maner: <i>N.</i> of V. has spoken with <i>N.</i> of P. to have hir to his
wife, and to ryght lyve in forme of holy chyrche. If any mon knowe
any lettyng qwy they may not come togedyr say now or never on
payne of cursyng.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the day appointed for the marriage, at the door of the
church, the priest shall interrogate the parties as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>N.</i> Hast thu wille to have this wommon to thi wedded wif.
<i>R.</i> Ye syr. My thu wel fynde at thi best to love hur and hold ye
to hur and to no other to thi lives end. <i>R.</i> Ye syr. Then take her
by yor hande and say after me: I <i>N.</i> take the <i>N.</i> in forme of holy
chyrche to my wedded wyfe, forsakyng alle other, holdyng me
hollych to the, in sekenes and in hele, in ryches and in poverte, in
well and in wo, tyl deth us departe, and there to I plyght ye my
trowthe.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then the woman repeated the form as above.</p>

<p>It was this “Marriage at the church door” which had to
be established, according to Bracton, in any question as to
the legality or non-legality of the contract. After this
“taking to wife at the church door,” the parties entered the
church and completed the rite in the church itself. As in
the case of baptisms, churchings, and funerals, the fee for
marriages was fixed at 1<i>d.</i>, but apparently all who could
afford it, gave more.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Three ornaments,” says the author of <i>Dives and Pauper</i>—“three
ornaments (at marriage) belonged principally to the wyfe: a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
rynge on her finger, a broche on hyr breste, and a garlande on hir
head. The rynge betokeneth true love; the broche betokeneth
clenness of herte and chastity that she ought to have; and the
garland betokeneth the gladness and the dignity of the sacrament of
wedlock.”</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the ornaments for the bride at marriage the
parish provided. The nuptial veil was one of the things
which the churchwardens were supposed to find, and frequent
inquiries were made concerning it in the parochial visitations.
In one parish the wardens possessed “one standing mazer to
serve for brides at their wedding;” and in another, a set of
jewels was left in trust for the use of brides on their wedding
day. If lent outside the parish, they were to be paid for,
and the receipt was to go to the common purposes of the
church to which they belonged.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE PARISH PULPIT</p>


<p>The influence on parochial life of the Sunday sermon
and what went with it can hardly be exaggerated.
It was not only that it was at this time that the priest
instructed his people in their faith and in the practice of
their religion; but the pulpit was the means, and in those
days the sole means, by which the official or quasi-official
business of the place was announced to the inhabitants of
a district. The great variety of matters that had necessarily
to be brought to the notice of the parishioners would have
all tended to make the pulpit utterances on the Sunday,
in a pre-Reformation parish, both interesting and instructive.
In this chapter it is proposed to illustrate some of the many
features presented at the time of the Sunday sermon;
and first as to the regular religious teaching of faith and
morals.</p>


<p>The first duty of the Church, after seeing to the administration
of the Sacraments and the offering of the Sacrifice
of the Altar, was obviously to teach and direct its children in
all matters of belief and practice. This was done from the
pulpit, which was in all probability an unpretentious wooden
erection, perhaps in the screen, or at the chancel arch. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
one case there is given the cost of the erection of a pulpit
of wood; another churchwardens’
account speaks of “clasps
for” the pulpit (?), possibly
hinges for the door; a third tells
of “a green silk veil for the
pulpit”; and a fourth of “cloth
and a pillow” for it. The chief
interest, however, is not in the
thing itself, but in its use.</p>

</figure>

<p>It is impossible to think that
Chaucer’s typical priest was a
mere creation of his imagination.
The picture must have
had its counterpart in numberless
parishes in England in the
fourteenth century. This is how
the poet’s priest is described:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A good man was ther of religioun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And was a poure parsoun of a town;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But riche he was of holy thought and werk.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He was also a lerned man, a clerk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Christe’s Gospel trewely wolde preche,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His parischens devoutly wolde he teche.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<hr class="tiny">
  
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But Christe’s lore and His Apostles twelve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He taughte, but first he folwede it himselve.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will be remembered, too, that the story Chaucer makes
his priest contribute to the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> is nothing else
than an excellent and complete tract, almost certainly a
translation of a Latin theological treatise, upon the Sacrament
of Penance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>As a sample, however, of what is popularly believed on
this subject at the present day, it is well to take the opinion
of by no means an extreme party writer, Bishop Hobhouse.
“Preaching,” he says, “was not a regular part of the Sunday
observances as now. It was rare, but we must not conclude
from the silence of our MSS. (<i>i.e.</i> churchwardens’ accounts)
that it was never practised.” In another place he states,
upon what he thinks sufficient evidence, “that there was
a total absence of any system of clerical training, and that
the cultivation of the conscience as the directing power of
man’s soul, and the implanting of holy affections in the
heart seem to have been no part of the Church’s system of
guidance.” That this is certainly not a correct view as to
the way in which the pastors of the parochial churches in
pre-Reformation days discharged—or rather neglected—their
duties, in view of the facts, appears to be certain. The
grounds for this opinion are the following: for practical
purposes we may divide the religious teaching, given by
the clergy, into the two classes of <i>sermons</i> and <i>instructions</i>.
The distinction is obvious. By the first are meant those set
discourses to prove some definite theme, or expound some
definite passage of Holy Scripture, or deduce the lessons
to be learnt from the life of some saint. In other words,
putting aside the controversial aspect, which, of course, was
rare in those days, a sermon in mediæval times was much
what a sermon is to-day. There was this difference, however,
that in pre-Reformation days the sermon was not probably
so frequent as in these modern times. Now, whatever
instruction is given to the people at large is conveyed to
them almost entirely in the form of set sermons, which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
however admirable in themselves, seldom convey to their
hearers consecutive and systematic, dogmatic and moral
teaching. Mediæval methods of imparting religious knowledge
were different. For the most part the priest fulfilled
the duty of instructing his flock by plain, unadorned, and
familiar instructions upon matters of faith and practice.
These must have much more resembled our present catechetical
instructions than our modern pulpit discourses. To
the subject of set sermons I shall have occasion to return
presently, but as vastly more important, at any rate in the
opinion of our Catholic forefathers, let us first consider the
question of familiar instructions. For the sake of clearness
we will confine our attention to the two centuries (the
fourteenth and fifteenth) previous to the great religious
revolution under Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Before the close of the thirteenth century, namely, in
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1281, Archbishop Peckham issued the celebrated Constitutions
of the Synod of Oxford which are called by his
name. There we find the instruction of the people legislated
for minutely.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We order,” runs the Constitution, “that every priest having
the charge of a flock do, four times in each year (that is, once each
quarter), on one or more solemn feast days, either himself or by
some one else, instruct the people in the vulgar language, simply and
without any fantastical admixture of subtle distinctions, in the
articles of the Creed, the Ten Commandments, the Evangelical
Precepts, the seven works of mercy, the seven deadly sins with their
offshoots, the seven principal virtues, and the Seven Sacraments.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Synod then proceeded to set out in considerable
detail each of the points upon which the people must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
instructed. Now, it is obvious that if four times a year this
law was complied with in the spirit in which it was given,
the people were very thoroughly
instructed indeed in their faith. But
was this law faithfully carried out
by the clergy, and rigorously enforced
by the bishops in the succeeding
centuries? That is the
real question. I think that there
is ample evidence that it was. In
the first place, the Constitutions of
Peckham are referred to constantly
in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
as the foundation of the
existing practices in the English
Church. Thus, to take a few specific
instances in the middle of the
fourteenth century, the decree of a diocesan Synod orders—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That all rectors, vicars, or chaplains holding ecclesiastical offices
shall expound clearly and plainly to their people, on all Sundays
and feast days, the Word of God and the Catholic faith of the
Apostles; and that they shall diligently instruct their subjects in
the articles of faith, and teach them in their native language the
Apostles’ Creed, and urge them to expound it and teach the same
faith to their children.”</p>
</div>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_215.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">STONE PULPIT BRACKET, WALPOLE
ST. ANDREW, NORFOLK</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Again, in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1357, Archbishop Thoresby, of York,
anxious for the better instruction of his people, commissioned
a monk of St. Mary’s, York, named Gatryke, to draw out in
English an exposition of the Creed, the Commandments, the
seven deadly sins, etc. This tract the archbishop, as he says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
in his preface, through the counsel of his clergy, sent to all
his priests—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“So that each and every one, who under him had the charge of
souls, do openly in English, upon Sundays teach and preach them,
that they have cure of the law and the way to know God Almighty.
And he commands and bids, in all that he may, that all who have
keeping or cure under him, enjoin their parishioners and their
subjects, that they hear and learn all these things, and oft, either
rehearse them till they know them, and so teach them to their
children, if they any have, when they are old enough to learn them;
and that parsons and vicars and all parish priests inquire diligently
of their subjects at Lent-time, when they come to shrift, whether
they know these things, and if it be found that they know them not,
that they enjoin them upon his behalf, and on pain of penance, to
know them. And so there be none to excuse themselves through
ignorance of them, our father, the Archbishop, of his goodness has
ordained and bidden that they be showed openly in English amongst
the flock.”</p>
</div>

  <figcaption class="caption">SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To take another example: the Acts of the Synod, held by
Simon Langham at Ely in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1364, order that every parish
priest frequently preach and expound the Ten Commandments,
etc., in English (<i>in idiomate communi</i>), and all priests
are urged to devote themselves to the study of the Sacred
Scriptures, so as to be ready “to give an account of the hope
and faith” that are in them. Further, they are to see that
the children are taught their prayers; and even adults, when
coming to confession, are to be examined as to their religious
knowledge.</p>

<p>Even when the rise of the Lollard heretics rendered it
important that some check should be given to general and
unauthorized preaching, this did not interfere with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
ordinary work of instruction. The orders of Archbishop
Arundel in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1408, forbidding all preaching without an episcopal
licence, set forth in distinct terms, that this prohibition
did not apply “to the parish priests,” etc., who by the Constitutions
of Archbishop Peckham were bound to instruct
their people, in simple language, on all matters concerning
their faith and observance. And further, in order to check
the practice of treating people to such formal and set discourses,
these simple and practical instructions were ordered
to be adopted without delay in all parish churches.</p>

<p>To this testimony of the English Church as to the value
attached to popular instruction may be added the authority
of the Provincial Council of York, held in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1466 by Archbishop
Nevill. By its decrees not only is the order as to
systematic quarterly and simple instructions reiterated, but
the points of the teaching are again set out by the Synod
in great detail.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, ample evidence to convince any one
who may desire to study the subject, that this duty of giving
plain instructions to the people was not neglected up to the
era of the Reformation itself. During the fifteenth century,
manuals to assist the clergy in the performance of this obligation
were multiplied in considerable numbers; which would
not have been the case had the practice of frequently giving
these familiar expositions fallen into abeyance. To some of
these manuals it will be necessary to refer presently, but here
should be noted specially the fact that one of the earliest
books ever issued from an English press by Caxton, probably
at the same time (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1483) as the <i>Liber Festivalis</i> (or book
of sermons for Sundays and feast days), was a set of four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
lengthy discourses, published, as they expressly declare, to
enable priests to fulfil the obligation imposed on them by the
Constitutions of Peckham. As these were intended to take
at least four Sundays, and as the whole set of instructions
had to be given four times each year, it follows that at least
sixteen Sundays, or a quarter of the year, were devoted to
this simple and straightforward teaching of what every
Christian was bound to believe and to do.</p>

<p>That the parish priests really did their duty in instructing
their people there is evidence of another, and that an official
character. The Episcopal, or Chapter Registers fortunately
in some few cases contain documents recording the results of
the regular Visitations of parishes. It is almost by chance,
of course, that papers of this kind have been preserved.
Most of them would have been destroyed as possessing little
importance in the opinion of those who ransacked the archives
at the time of the change of religion. The testimony of these
Visitation papers as to the performance of this duty of instruction
on the part of the clergy is most valuable. Hardly
less important is the proof they afford of the intelligent
interest taken by the lay-folk of the parish in the work, and
of their capability of rationally and religiously appreciating
these instructions given them by their clergy. The process
of these Visitations must be understood to fully appreciate
the significance of their testimony. First of all, certain of
the parishioners were chosen and were examined upon oath
as to the state of the parish, and as to the way in
which the pastor performed his duties. As samples of
these sworn depositions, what are to be found in a “Visitation
of Capitular manors and estates of the Exeter diocese”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
may be taken; extracts from these have been printed not
long ago by Prebendary Hingeston Randolph, in the Register
of Bishop Stapeldon. The record of these Visitations comprises
the first fifteen years of the fourteenth century; at
one place, Colaton, we find the <i>jurati</i> depose that their
parson preaches in his own way, and on the Sundays expounds
the Gospels, as well as he can (<i>quatenus novit</i>)! He
does not give them much instruction (<i>non multum eos informat</i>),
they think, in “the articles of faith, the Ten Commandments,
and the deadly sins.” At another place, the
priest, one Robert Blond, “preaches, but,” as appears to the
witnesses, “not sufficiently clearly;” but they add, as if
conscious of some hypercriticism, that they had long been
accustomed to pastors who instructed them most carefully
in all that pertained to the salvation of their souls. But these
are perhaps the least satisfactory cases. In most instances
the priest is said to instruct his people “well” (<i>bene</i>), and
“excellently” (<i>optime</i>), and the truth of the testimony appears
more clearly in places where, in other things, the parish-folk
do not consider that their priest was quite perfection; as, for
instance, at Culmstock, where the vicar, Walter, is said to be
too long over the Matins and Mass on feasts; or still more at
St. Mary Church, where the people think that in looking
after his worldly interests, their priest was somewhat too hard
on them in matters of tithe.</p>

<p>The Register from which these details are taken is a mere
accidental survival, but the point which it is of importance
to remember is this: that during Catholic times, in the
course of every few years the clergy were thus personally
reported upon, so to say, to the chief pastor or his delegates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
and the oaths of the witnesses is a proof of how gravely this
duty was regarded. And here may be noted, in passing, a
fact not realized nor even understood, namely, that one of
the great differences between ecclesiastical life in the Middle
Ages and modern times lies in the fact that then people had
no chance “of going to sleep.” There was a regular system
of periodical Visitations, and everything was brought to the
test of inquiry of a most elaborate and searching kind, in
which every corner, so to speak, was swept out.</p>

<p>In this special instance, before passing on, attention may
be called to the manifest intelligence, in spiritual things,
shown by these jurors—peasants and farmers—in out-of-the-way
parishes of clod-hopping Devon, in the early years of the
fourteenth century.</p>

<p>To assist priests in the preparation of these familiar discourses,
manuals of all kinds were drawn up in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries. It is impossible here to do more than
give the names of a few of the best known. They are (1) The
<i>Pars Oculi Sacerdotis</i>, by William Pagula, or Parker. (2)
The <i>Papilla Oculi</i>, by John de Burgo, Rector of Collingham
in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1385. (3) The <i>Regimen Animarum</i>, compiled about
1343. (4) The <i>Speculum Christiani</i>, by John Walton. (5)
The <i>Flos Florum</i>, etc. All these, and many others like them,
may be called popular books of instruction. Besides these,
of course, there are a multitude of theological text-books,
all calculated to aid the clergy in what the great Grosseteste
calls “as much a part of the <i>cura pastoralis</i> as the administration
of the Sacraments.”</p>

<p>In the same way that the work of instruction proper took
a fixed form, so that of preaching was fashioned on a well-understood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
and well-recognized model. A short exordium,
following upon the chosen text of Scripture, led almost invariably
to a prayer for Divine guidance and assistance,
which concluded with the <i>Pater</i> and <i>Ave</i>, and only then did
the preacher address himself to the development of his
subject. For the most part, until comparatively recent
times, which have introduced somewhat strange themes into
the sacred pulpit, the sermon was based almost entirely upon
the Bible, and generally upon the Gospel or other Scripture
proper for the day. This practice, whilst it imbued the minds
of those who listened with a thorough knowledge of the
sacred writings, gives the sermons, as we read them now, so
great a similarity that we are apt to regard them as generally
dull and uninteresting. With rare exceptions it is clear
that, in England at least, brilliant, startling, and sensational
sermonizing was not regarded with favour, but, on the
contrary, was looked on with suspicion, as savouring of
the “treatise” or method of the schools, and founded on
the practice of heretics.</p>

<p>Surveying the ground of parochial preaching, one or two
facts seem to stand out from the background of much that is
still vague and uncertain. First, it is certain that popular
and vernacular teaching was by no means neglected by the
parish priests in pre-Reformation pulpits. Next to this is
the prominence given to homely and familiar instruction, as
distinct from formal sermons, and the importance which in
those days was attached to the constant reiteration of the
same old, yet ever new, lessons of faith and practice. On
the part of the people hearing of sermons was taught as
a duty, and they had to examine their consciences as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
whether they had tried to shirk the obligation. As Myrc
puts it—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Has thou wythowte devocyone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I-herde any predicacyon?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hast thou gon or setten else where</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When thou myghtest have ben there?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Besides the sermon, which followed upon the reading or
singing of the Gospel in the Mass, there were several other
Sunday practices connected with the pulpit. First may be
mentioned the reading of the <i>Bede-roll</i>. This was of two
kinds, general and particular, and Dr. Rock has printed an
interesting specimen of the first and several examples of the
second. From the first a few quotations will make the nature
and intention of the Church in the “Bidding of Bedes” quite
clear. It begins—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Masters and frendes, as for holy dayes and fasting days ye shall
have none thys weke” (of course, when there were any they were
named), “but ye maye doe all manner of good workes, that shall bee
to the honoure of God and the profyt of your own soules. And
therefore, after a laudable consuetude and lawfull custome of our
mother holy Churche, ye shall knele down movyng your heartes
unto Almightye God, and makyng your speciall prayers for the three
estates, concerning all christian people, that is to say for the
spiritualtye and temporaltie and the soules being in the paynes
of purgatory.”</p>
</div>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_222fp.jpg" alt="">

<figure class="figcenter illowp74" id="i_222fp-2" style="max-width: 22.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_222fp-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">YOUTHS RECEIVING HOLY COMMUNION</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then after mentioning the Pope, the metropolitan, the
bishop, and parish priests “having cure of mannes soule,”
and in the “temporalty” the king, queen, and royal family,
with the lords, etc., the priest from the pulpit recommended
to the people’s prayers all those “that have honoured the
church wyth light, lamp, vestment, or bell, or any ornaments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
by the whyche the service of Almighty God is the better
maintained and kept.”</p>

<p>After this, prayers were asked for all workers and tillers
of the earth; for the fruits and for proper weather for them;
for those in “debt or deadly sin,” that God may free them;
for the sick and for all pilgrims; and “for women that be
in our ladyes bondes, that Almighty God may send them
grace, the child to receive the sacrament of baptism, and the
mother purification. Also ye shall praye for the good man or
woman, that this daye geveth bread to make the holy lofe,
and for all those that fyrste began it, and them that longest
continue.”</p>

<p>The priest then turned towards the altar for the <i>Pater</i>
and <i>Ave</i> with the psalm <i>Deus misereatur</i>, etc., and these being
finished, he turned once more towards the people and said—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Thirdly, ye shall pray for your frends’ soules, as your father’s
soule, your mother’s soule, your brethren’s soule, your sister’s soul,
your godfather’s soule, your godmother’s soul, and for all those
souls whose bones rest in this church and churchyard, ... and
above all, for those soules whose names be accustomed to be
rehearsed in the bederoll as I shall rehearse them unto you by the
grace of God.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then followed the reading of the names from the bede-roll,
one specimen of which has been preserved by the antiquary
Hearne, and which, he says, is drawn up on a large octavo
leaf of vellum, and contains merely a series of names, at the
end of which is the formula: “God have mercy on these
souls and of all Crystyn soules.”</p>

<p>This catalogue of names, sometimes called the “Dominical
Roll,” was the shortened form for ordinary occasions, but on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
certain days, such as “All Saints’ day,” there was in the case
of benefactors a longer form, which set forth the individual
reasons why the people should specially remember these
dead in their prayers. For entering the names on this roll,
a fee was paid to the parson by the parish; thus at Laverton,
in 1521, there is the entry in the churchwardens’ accounts:
“Fee to William Wright, the parish priest, for entering the
names of Thomas Greste, Agnes his wife, and John and
William their children, on the bede-roll.”</p>

<p>As examples of the longer form of proclamation may be
given an entry already cited on the bede-roll of St. Michael’s,
Cornhill, which runs thus—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You must pray—for Richard Atfield, sometime parish parson
of this church, for he with the consent of the Bishop ordained and
established Matins, High Mass, and Even-song, to be sung daily in
the year 1375.”</p>
</div>

<p>Or the following from the Laverton account—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The suit of red purple velvet vestments were given by Sir John
Wright, parson, son of William Wright and Elizabeth, for the which
you shall specially pray for the souls” of the above, etc., “and for all
benefactors as well as them that be off lyve as be departed to the
mercy of God, for whose lives and soules is given heyr to the honour
of God, His most blessed mother our Lady Saynt Mare and all His
saints being in Heaven and the blessed matron Saynte Helene—and
they to be usyd at such principal feasts and times as it shall please
ye curates, as long as they shall last—for all these souls and all
Christian souls ye shall say one <i>Pater noster</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>In many instances it was apparently the curate’s duty to
read the parish bede-roll, and the stipend he received for
performing this service was part of his benefice. In other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
cases, a fee was paid to the parson on the day when the roll
was read. Thus at St. Mary-at-Hill, in 1490, there is a
payment by the wardens, entered as follows: “<i>Item.</i> To Mr.
John Redy for rehersyng of the bederoll, 8<i>d.</i>” One purpose
served by thus keeping the memory of the good deeds of
parishioners who had passed away, before the memory of
their successors, was that it stimulated the latter to emulate
the example of these benefactors. Bishop Hobhouse is
obviously right when he says that popular bounty was undoubtedly
elicited by hearing the names of the doers of
past generous deeds read out in church on great days. All,
in pre-Reformation days, appear to have been anxious,
according to their means, to find a place on this roll of
honour.</p>

<p>Very similar to this bede-roll was what was known as
the “Quethe-word,” for which fees are recorded so often as
having been paid. Apparently this was the announcement
of the death of a parishioner made for the first time after
his decease. The fee for the speaking of this “Quethe-word”
was usually paid by the wardens of the parish, but
possibly only when bequests had been made by the deceased
to the “common stock” of the parish.</p>

<p>Besides this kind of Sunday notice, the pulpit was the
means by which all manner of ecclesiastical or quasi-ecclesiastical
business was notified. In the first place, of course, the
banns of intended marriages were published on three successive
Sundays and feast days. Then such warnings to parents
were given as reminding them of the necessity of seeing that
their children receive Confirmation, with the information
that the bishop would either be in the church or in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
neighbourhood at such a time. The Council of Oxford
ordered that parish priests were frequently to warn parents
from the pulpit about this duty of not delaying to bring
up their children to the bishop.</p>

<p>Then there were constant appeals being made for assistance
of some kind or other, generally of a public or semi-public
character, supported by an indulgence, or grant of
spiritual favours from the bishop. To take an example:
some time about 1270, Walter Langton, Bishop of Coventry
and Lichfield, wrote a letter on behalf of a work, for which
one John Perty was collecting. John Perty was the procurator
and collector of the bridge at or near Colwich, and he was
trying to get money to repair, or rather to rebuild, the bridge
and its chapel, and at the same time to gather sufficient
endowment to maintain a priest. The bishop asks all his
priests to explain the matter from their pulpits, to show that
it was a work of charity, and to say that to all who contribute
in any way he grants forty days of indulgence under the
usual conditions.</p>

<p>The same bishop at another time orders all rectors and
parish priests to publish “at the time of their sermons and
exhortations” his indulgence to all who would visit the
cathedral church of Lichfield and contribute to the building
of the spires of his cathedral. Other episcopal letters, which
were all to be read in the parish churches, were of a more
private character. One man, for instance, had suffered great
losses through a fire, which had destroyed his house; another
had had his barns burned; a third had been left almost
destitute by having his crops destroyed by floods; a fourth
had been plundered by robbers; a fifth had suffered the loss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
of an arm, etc. In all such cases, if those who asked could
prove that their needs were genuine, the bishop had not
apparently much hesitation in granting letters of indulgence
to those who would help in these Christian charities; and all
such letters became matter for the Sunday parish pulpit.</p>

<p>Then, it was in the church that all laws, civil as well
as ecclesiastical, were published. Here, too, notice of all
manner of civil proceedings was made. A, for instance,
had died and been laid to rest in the churchyard; it is
from the pulpit of his parish church that the fact is announced
that he has left B and E the executors of his will, and people
are notified to send in their claims, or pay what is owing to
the estate to these two. Or it may be that A has died
intestate, or that those he has appointed to carry out his
wishes will not do so, in which cases people are to be warned
that the bishop’s official will administer the estate, and all
claims are to be sent in to him.</p>

<p>Then all questions of social order and well-being, as well
as infraction of law in the district, came before the people
in some form or other in the church and from the pulpit.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When Agnes Paston,” for example, “built a wall (across a
property to which the people claimed access), it was thrown down
before it was half completed, and threats of heavy amercements
(says Dr. Gairdner) were addressed to her in church, and the men
of Paston spoke of showing their displeasure when they went in
public procession on St. Mark’s day.”</p>
</div>

<p>So, also, the parish priest of Standon, at the beginning of the
fifteenth century, was ordered to publish an excommunication
under the following circumstances: Margaret Basun, a parishioner,
was charged by some people with having stolen a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
silver ring belonging to Alice Braymer, and with having
sold it to Anne Boghley. Margaret Basun denied the truth,
and was called to make canonical purgation before the bishop.
She did so, and the bishop, having heard the case, declared
her innocent of the charge, and ordered her innocence to be
proclaimed, and an excommunication to be pronounced against
those who had defamed her.</p>

<p>To take another sample case: a man spread false stories
about the apprentices of his father, saying that they had been
the thieves of some goods, etc., which had been stolen. An
examination by the bishop revealed the fact that it was the
accuser who was in reality the robber, and it was proved that
he had made a false key, had opened his father’s chest, and
taken from it money and jewels. The bishop directed that
this should be told the people on the following Sunday.</p>

<p>Once more: a person has been much defamed in his
parish by people saying he had buried a child in his back
garden. He denied this charge utterly, and the denial was
published to the people from the pulpit, whilst his accusers
were warned to come before the bishop and oppose his purgation.
Or, lastly: John Spencer, the official of the Archdeacon
of Lincoln, issued a letter to be read in the parish church, in
which he declares that he has had before him Alice B. and
Matilda S. The former had defamed the latter by calling
her a <i>meretrix</i>. On examination this was found to be untrue,
and Matilda S. was declared innocent. Alice B. is to be compelled
to cease these injuries, and to pay all the expenses.</p>

<p>Another set of proclamations which had to be made on
the Sunday from the parish pulpit were the excommunications
pronounced by the bishop or by some other authority.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
In the Register of Bishop Bronescombe is a document, dated
November 24, 1277, pronouncing two people of good family
excommunicated for living together without being rightly
married. The fact is notorious, and “the keys of the Church
are vilely despised,” and this contempt may be hurtful to
ecclesiastical authority if allowed to continue. For this
reason the bishop’s sentence of excommunication is ordered
to be published in every church and chapel. A second
instance may be taken from Bishop Grandisson’s Register
for 1335. It appears that one John Hayward, the bailiff
of Plympton Priory, for some reason not apparent, took
sanctuary in the church of Sutton. Despising the sanctity
of the place, some people unknown broke down the doors of
the church, and, dragging the unfortunate man from his place
of safety, wounded him, and even broke both his thighs. The
bishop consequently orders the sentence of greater excommunication
to be pronounced upon the unknown criminals,
“with bell and candle,” in all churches.</p>

<p>Other instances of excommunications published from the
church pulpit are: (1) For detaining “charters, rolls, indentures,
bills, evidences, and other muniments,” which had to
do with the right of a man’s succession to the estate of his
father. The persons holding the documents are unknown,
and so all who have them, or are assisting in concealing them,
are excommunicated after fifteen days. (2) For stealing a
trap to catch eels, set in a pool called in English “a leap,”
and throwing it into a pool in the town of C, belonging to
the Prior of O. (3) For laying violent hands on a priest,
who was known to be one by his dress and tonsure. (4) For
breaking into the room of Thomas, rector of a London parish.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
The room was, by the way, in the Campanile, and the thieves
took clothes, gold, and silver to the value of 40<i>s.</i>, etc.</p>

<p>As a final instance of this kind of denunciation, an incident
recorded in Bishop Grandisson’s Register for 1348 may
be given. There had been, the bishop says, much talk, and
many complaints had reached his ears about a woman named
Margery Kytel, who exercised magic arts, and was regarded
as a witch. He (the bishop) had cited her to appear to
answer the charge; but she had not done so. The major
excommunication is ordered to be pronounced against her,
and all people in every church and chapel are to be warned,
under the same penalty, not to have anything to do with her,
still less to consult this “phitonessa demonica.”</p>

<p>A further class of parish notices were the citations of
principles and witnesses to ecclesiastical courts. For instance,
on February 19, 1426, an order was given to the
chaplain who served the chapel of Baddesley to cite those
who had acted as executors of the wills of John Barkeby and
Juliana Power, for having done so without the leave of the
Bishop of Coventry. In answer to this, John West, Vicar of
Pollesworth, certifies that he has published the citation, and
that Nicholas Power, the son of the above-named Juliana,
had acted as her executor and that of John Barkeby. As a
second example may be given the case of a rector of a parish
church in Staffordshire, who was ordered to cite two of his
parishioners, Thomas Grenegore and his wife, for keeping a
bad house in the parish, to appear at the prebendal church of
Eccleshall on August 10, 1426, “to receive correction for the
good of their souls.” Of much the same kind is the letter of
William, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, in 1441, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
recites that Thomas, son of Richard Tomlynson, of Marchington,
in the county of Stafford, on September 6, 1420,
broke into Sudbury church and stole three chalices, two
vestments worth &#163;10, one breviary, a surplice, and two
curtains, the property of the churchwardens. The said
Thomas, having been captured by the secular power, had
been handed over to the ecclesiastical authorities, and this
letter was to be published in the church of Sudbury, to
summon witnesses to appear at the bishop’s court.</p>

<p>Connected with this phase of parochial life were the public
penances which had to be performed in the parish churches.
In the comparatively rare instances of people convicted as
heretics, the punishment was so severe that, in these days,
it must cause astonishment that they were submitted to so
quietly. For such a cause the penitent had to walk barefooted
and dressed only in underclothing, bearing a bundle of
faggots, in the Sunday procession for three successive Sundays.
During the course of the passage of the clergy and people
through the churchyard, the priest was to give certain disciplines
(<i>fustigaciones</i>), and the penitent was then to kneel
at the entrance of the chancel during Mass, with the faggot
in front, and holding a candle in one hand. Other public
ecclesiastical punishments were hardly less severe. I. de B.,
for example, in the fourteenth century, was condemned to
undergo six public whippings (<i>fustigaciones</i>) on six Sundays
before the procession in his parish church, for having violently
beaten a cleric. In the fifteenth century, for a grave offence a
person was enjoined to go round the market-place of Marlborough
on two market days <i>nudus usque ad camisiam et
braccas</i>, and to be whipped by a priest at each corner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
This kind of penance, however, was not confined to the laity.
There are instances of clergy being made to do public
penances even in their own parish churches. For instance, the
rector of the church of O., being convicted before the bishop
of a crime, was sentenced to stand bareheaded at the font for
three Sundays during High Mass. He was to be vested in
surplice and stole, and to read his Psalter. He was then
to go as a penitential pilgrim to Lincoln, Canterbury, and
Beverley, and at each to offer a candle, and to bring back a
testimonial letter that this had been faithfully done.</p>

<p>To take one or two further examples of these public penances
in church, (1) A man convicted of the sin of incontinence,
which has been a scandal, is condemned to walk
with bare feet and bareheaded before his parish priest in the
procession on two solemn feast days. (2) A woman convicted
of unchastity, publicly known, is sentenced to three
fustigacions round the parish church in the usual penitential
way, <i>sola camisia duntaxat induta</i>. She is to hold a wax
candle of half a pound in weight from the beginning of Mass
till the Offertory, when it is to be offered to the image in the
chancel. This is to be done on three Sundays, and if the
condemned refuse to undergo the punishment, she is then to
be excommunicated, and is to be publicly proclaimed as such
on each feast day till she repent and undergo her penance.</p>

<p class="ph3">PARISH AMUSEMENTS</p>


<p>Notwithstanding that the parish was instituted
primarily for ecclesiastical objects, the people quickly
came to understand the utility of the organization for
common and social purposes. Although it was not till well
into the sixteenth century that any successful attempt was made
to impose by law upon the parishioners, as such, any purely
secular duty, such as the care of local roads and bridges, or
the repair of ditches, dykes, and sluices, the people’s wardens
had long before this assumed the superintendence of all the
common parochial amusements, and in some instances of
works, such as brewing and baking, etc., undertaken for the
common benefit or profit. These probably mostly sprang out
of their necessary management of parochial property, which
had a natural tendency to grow in extent, and in particular
of the “Church House,” which in one form or other most
parishes possessed.</p>

<p>The <i>Church House</i>.—Mr. J. M. Cowper, in his preface to
the <i>Accounts of the Churchwardens of St. Dunstan’s, Canterbury</i>,
gives a useful description of the purposes for which the
<i>Church</i>, or, as it was sometimes called, the <i>Parish</i>, <i>House</i>
existed. In the fifteenth century, and indeed before that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
the church was the real centre of all parochial life, social as
well as religious. “From the font to the grave the greater
number of people lived within the sound of its bells. It
provided them with all the consolations of religion, and linked
itself with such amusements as it did not directly supply.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_234" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_234.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">CHURCH HOUSE, LINCOLN</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Parish meetings not unfrequently settled local disputes.
Thus at Canterbury in 1485, at St. Dunstan’s, there was some
dispute between the parish and a man named Baker, and
the churchwardens spent 2&#189;<i>d.</i> on arbitration. Later on, two
families fell out, and the vicar and four parishioners met in
council, heard the parties, and put an end to the difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>A parish, with all the great interests involved in its proper
management, required some place where parish meetings
could be held. They were sometimes, no doubt, held in the
aisle of the parish church, but this arrangement was for
obvious reasons inconvenient, and a Church house became
a necessity. Its existence was apparently almost universal.
At Hackney, for instance, the parish built a house in which
to hold meetings. At Yatton, in Somerset, in 1445, the
people subscribed to the building of their house; at Tintinhull,
in the same county, one was completed in 1497; but
in 1531, another was erected to take the place of the older
one, and Thomas, Prior of Montacute, helped the parish with
a donation of twenty shillings.</p>

<p>The Church house was sometimes let out to tenants and
for various purposes, with a reservation of its use when necessary
for parochial meetings. Thus, at Wigtoft, the rent of
the house brought in a regular sum of money to the churchwardens.
At Straton, in the county of Cornwall, it was let
on occasion; as, for instance, in 1513, the accounts show a
receipt of 8<i>d.</i> “of Richard Rowell for occupying of the Church
house;” and of 12<i>d.</i> “of the paynters for working in the
Church house.” At the annual fair time the Church house
was let to wandering merchants to display their goods. At
St. Mary’s, Dover, in 1537, an item of parochial receipt was,
“one whole year’s farme of the churche house in Broad St.,
5 shillings.”</p>

<p>Sometimes there was land belonging to the parish,
which was let together with the house; as, for example, at
Cratfield, where, in 1534, an acre of land was let with the
“Church house.” Very probably this was the land on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
subsequently the parish shooting-butts were erected. If there
were receipts to the parish, there were, of course, also expenses
for repairs to the common house, which in some
accounts appear to be very frequent, and which shows probably
that it was much used. In one or two instances there
seems to have been two floors to the house, and in one of
these instances these were let out separately, one of the two
tenants being a woman.</p>

<p>In many cases it is clear that cooking was done on
the premises for the parish meetings. In some Wiltshire
accounts there is evidence of this, and of utensils of various
kinds being kept in the house for parochial feasting and for
ministering to the poor. The householders made merry and
collected money for church purposes, and the younger people
had dancing and bowls in many places, “while the ancients
sat gravely by.” At St. Dunstan’s, in Canterbury, there were
two dozen trenchers and spoons, and one annual dinner is
mentioned.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Dr. Jessopp thus speaks of these Church houses—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Frequently, indeed, one may say usually, there was a church
house, a kind of parish club, in which the gilds held their meetings
and transacted their business. Sometimes this Church-house was
called the Gild hall; for you must not make the mistake of thinking
that the Church houses were places of residence for the clergy.
Nothing of the kind. The Church house or Gild hall grew up
as an institution which had become necessary when the social
life of the parish had outgrown the accommodation which the
church could afford, and when, indeed, there was just a trifle too
much boisterous merriment and too little seriousness and sobriety
to allow of the assemblies being held in the church at all. The
Church-house in many places became one of the most important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
buildings in a parish, and in the little town of Dereham, in Norfolk,
the Church-house or Gild hall is still, I think, the largest house in the
town. When the great fire took place at Dereham, in 1581, which
destroyed almost the whole town, the Gild hall or Church house, from
being well built of stone, was almost the only building in the place
which escaped the terrible conflagration.”</p>
</div>

<p>The owners of the Church house, or “Court house,” as it
was sometimes called, were, of course, the churchwardens, as
trustees of the parishioners, and they made all the necessary
arrangements to let or lease it. At Berkhampstead “they
always reserved to themselves the right of using the great
loft”, which apparently occupied the whole upper story, as
well at other times as when they kept the feast. It was in
this common hall, evidently, that some of the property of the
parish was kept ready for use. At Pilton, in Somerset, for
example, there is mentioned “a slegge to break stones at
the quarey;” and the “eight tabyle clothes” point to parish
dinners.</p>

<p>One of the ways of eliciting good-will among the
parishioners, and also of making a profit for the common
chest, was the “church ale.” This was a parish meeting at
which cakes and small beer were purchased from the churchwardens,
and consumed for the good of the parish. No
doubt there were amusements of various kinds during the
<i>potatio</i>, and there was generally a collection. At Cratfield,
for instance, in 1490, the chief source of income was from the
“church ales.” There were about five of these parish feasts
held in each year, and one of them was instituted by a
parishioner, William Brews, who left nine shillings in his
will for that purpose. Very commonly a collection for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
expenses of the common amusements was made by the working
men on the first Monday after Twelfth night—the first
Monday of work after the Christmas holidays. They drew
a plough round to the various houses, asking for donations,
and from this the day became known as “Plough Monday.”</p>

<p>Mr. Peacock, in the <i>Archæological Journal</i> (vol. xl.), has
given some interesting particulars he has been able to gather
about the village “ales.” The drink itself was apparently a
sweet beverage made with hops or bitter herbs. It was not
the same as the more modern beer; but was less heavy, and
hardly an intoxicant. The meeting was by no means devoid
of the religious aspect, and to some extent its purpose and
connection with the church secured this. Cups were used
which were frequently dedicated, especially the general or
loving cup, to saints. At Boston there was a tankard named
after St. Thomas. Archbishop Scrope, of York, attached an
indulgence to one such cup: “unto all them that drinks of
this cope X days of pardon.” In these days, no doubt, such
a curious mingling of things sacred and profane will appear
incongruous; but in the Middle Ages Christian life was a
much simpler organization than it became after the days of
Henry VIII. Religion was before that period a part of the
people’s daily life, and its influence overflowed into all the
social amusements of the people. As already pointed out,
the authority of the Church settled most of the minor
difficulties, disputes, and quarrels of the nation without the
assistance of the State. Its vitality was everywhere visible.
Justices of the peace and police magistrates were then
wholly unknown. The manor court and the parson in his
Sunday pulpit settled everything. So, too, the “ales” were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
under the protection of the Church, and took place with its
distinct encouragement.</p>

<p>Mr. Peacock thus sketches the probable appearance of one
of these halls for holding the “church ale”—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We must picture to ourselves a long, low room with an ample
fireplace, or rather a big open chimney occupying one end with a
vast hearth. Here the cooking would be done, and the water boiled
for brewing the church ale. There would be, no doubt, a large oak
table in the middle, with benches around, and a lean-to building on
one side to act as a cellar.”</p>
</div>

<p>Just as all the churches were made beautiful by religious
paintings, so probably the Church house—the people’s hall—was
made gay and bright with decoration, permanent or
temporary.</p>

<p>At these Church feasts there was an important factor—the
collection. Dr. Jessopp speaks about this feature of parochial
life—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Among the most profitable sources of revenue known to the
wardens were the great festive entertainments called the <i>Church ales</i>.
They have almost their exact counterparts in our modern <i>public
dinners</i> for charitable (?) purposes, such as the annual dinner for the
literary fund, or for the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy; and
the <i>public teas</i> so common among the Nonconformist bodies. They
were held in the Church houses, which were well furnished with all
the necessary appliances for cooking, brewing, and for giving accommodation
for a large company. Often a generous parishioner would
provide a bullock or a sheep or two for the entertainment, and
another good-natured man would offer a quarter of malt to be
brewed for the occasion. The skins of the slaughtered sheep are
often entered on the credit side of the accounts, and occasionally
smaller contributions of spices and other condiments were offered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
Of course, the inevitable collection followed; and, according to the
goodness of the feast, the number of the guests, or their satisfaction
with the arrangements made, the amount of donations was large or
small.”</p>
</div>

<p>To take an example or two of these collections: at
Walberswick, in the county of Suffolk, in 1453, the “church
ales” produced 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; at Bishop Stortford, in 1489, two
parish gatherings brought in &#163;4 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to the common exchequer.
At times, too, various neighbouring parishes would
unite their forces and have a joint church ale. At Yatton, in
Somerset, for example, the parishioners both entertained and
were entertained by a neighbouring parish; and in the “Book
of the accomptes of Bramley church” are entered “in expenses
of the parish of Silchester—5<i>s.</i>”; “in expenses of the
parish of Herteley—2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>” At Shire, in the county of
Surrey, an ale was held at Pentecost in 18 Henry VII. which
produced 56<i>s.</i>: of this sum Albury contributed 12<i>s.</i>, Wotton
5<i>s.</i>, Abinger 5<i>s.</i>, and Ewhurst 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> Out of this sum, 17<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>
was expended over the provisions for the feast, and the residue
was the amount available for the common fund. In 1536,
in the same place, there is an example of a private entertainment
given for the benefit of the parish. Thus was “a
drinking made by John Redford at his own expense, from
strangers attending at his instance, &#163;7 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>” In the parish
at Bramley there were apparently a whole series of dinners
and suppers in the week of Whitsuntide. These are worth
giving in full, as they have not previously been printed.</p>

<p><i>Hock-days.</i>—In many parishes there was a feast celebrated,
according to some, in memory of the massacre of the
Danes in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1002. It was called <i>Hock-day</i> and <i>Hock-tyde</i>,
and seems to have been specially the women’s feast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
in the parish. The second Monday and Tuesday after Easter
were the Hock-tyde days, on which, with some sportive traditional
customs, money was collected for parish purposes.
According to an early custom, women seized and bound men
and then demanded a small payment for their release. This
seems to have been prohibited, and then recourse was had to
stopping roadways and bridges with ropes, and demanding a
toll from all men who desired to pass. For example, at Shire
in Surrey in 1536, 8<i>s.</i> are entered in the accounts, as coming
“from the collection of pennies by the married women on
Hokmonday.” In the accounts of St. Mary the Great, Cambridge,
in 1518, there are two entries of receipt for Hockday
money: “<i>Item</i> Receyved of Mistres Sabyn, Mistress Butt,
Mistres Halbed and other wyfys of money gathered by them
on Hockmonday—20 shillings ... and <i>Memorandum</i> that
there remayneth in the hands of Kateryn Hawes in halfpenys
of the gatheryng on Hockmonday—2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>” So also
in the accounts of St. Mary-at-Hill, London, for 1511-12,
there is this item: “<i>Received</i> of the Gadryng of hok monday
by the wemen 20<i>s.</i>: <i>Rec.</i> of the Gadryng on Tewysday 4<i>s.</i>”
In the parish of SS. Edmund and Thomas, Salisbury, the
women paid a composition to escape “binding” on the
Tuesday of Hocktide. In the year 1499-1500, for example,
there is the following entry in the accounts: “<i>Received</i> of
divers wives and maidens to save them from binding in Hok
Tuesday in all the year, 5 shillings.” In another account we
learn that the “maidens” kept a bridge over which all had
to pass on this Hock Monday, and that they gathered much
in the way of fees for passengers. It may be here remarked
that in the way of raising money for parish work, or, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
particular, for the beautifying of their churches, the women-folk
were in no ways behind the men. There are constant
notices of gifts, etc., in the parish accounts; and such entries
as one at Walberswick in Suffolk, in 1496: “By a gaderyng
of the wyves in the towne for a glass wyndow, 9 shillings,”
are common features in the mediæval accounts.</p>

<p>The women-folk also had their feast at the Church house
on certain days when the parish came together for the
purpose of dancing. In 1538, at Salisbury, there is a receipt
from the “wyves daunce.” At St. Ewen’s, Bristol, there was
special “dancing money,” and at Croscombe in Somerset an
item of receipt of 6<i>s.</i> in 1483 is said to be collected “of the
wives’ dancing.” Another form of collection by women in
some places was called “Robin Hood penny.”</p>

<p>In some parishes the supplying of the ale, etc., for the
parish entertainments no doubt led to the churchwardens
becoming purveyors of ale, etc., at other times, the profits
obtained by this trading going to swell the parish receipts.
Bishop Hobhouse remarks upon this in the case of Tintinhull,
a Somerset parish. The church house was the focus of
the social life in this neighbourhood. There was, at first, a
small place for making the sacred wafer and the “blessed
bread.” It grew by degrees into a bakery to supply all.
Then brewing was added, and the sale of ale to those who
wanted it. Apparently the bakery and the brewing utensils
were let out to those who wanted to make their own bread
and beer; but in the reign of Henry VII. a proper house
was procured by the parish, and a woman, “Agnes Cook,”
was placed in it to manage the increasing business.</p>

<p>At Bishop Stortford and elsewhere, also, there is evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
in the accounts of brewing being carried on for the benefit
of the parish. In some cases, the purchases of malt are considerable,
and suggests that the production of ale was for sale
generally to any in the parish.</p>

<p>Probably no single book gives such a vivid picture of the
social side of mediæval parochial life as the <i>Durham Halmote
Rolls</i>, published by the “Surtees Society.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is hardly a figure of speech,” writes Mr. Booth, in the preface
to this volume, “to say we have in (these rolls) village life photographed.
The dry record of tenures is peopled by men and women
who occupied them, whose acquaintance we make in these records
under the various phases of village life. We see them in their tofts
surrounded by their crofts, with their gardens of pot-herbs. We see
how they ordered the affairs of the village, when summoned by the
bailiff to the vill to consider matters which affected the common
weal of the community. We hear of their trespasses and wrongdoings,
and how they were remedied or punished; of their strifes
and contentions, and how they were repressed; of their attempts,
not always ineffective, to grasp the principle of co-operation as
shown by their by-laws; of their relations with the Prior, who represented
the convent, and alone stood in relation of lord. He appears
always to have dealt with his tenants, either in person or through
his officers, with much consideration; and in the imposition of fines
we find them invariably tempering justice with mercy.”</p>
</div>

<p>In fact, as the picture of mediæval village life among the
tenants of the Durham monastery is displayed in the pages
of this interesting volume, it would seem almost as if one
was reading of some Utopia of dreamland. Many of the
things that in these days advanced politicians would desire
to see introduced into the village communities of modern
England, to relieve the deadly dulness of country life, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
seen in Durham and Cumberland in full working order in
pre-Reformation days. Local provisions for public health
and general convenience are evidenced by the watchful
vigilance of the village officials over the water supplies, the
care taken to prevent the fouling of useful streams, and
stringent by-laws as to the common place for clothes-washing,
and the times for emptying and cleansing ponds and mill-dams.
Labour was lightened and the burdens of life eased
by co-operation on an extensive scale. A common mill
ground the corn, and the flour was baked into bread at a
common oven. A common smith worked at a common
forge, and common shepherds and herdsmen watched the
sheep and cattle of various tenants, which were pastured on
the fields common to the whole village community. The
pages of the volume contain numerous instances of the
kindly consideration for their tenants which characterized
the monastic proprietors, and the relation between them was
rather that of rentchargers than of men claiming absolute
ownership. In fact, as the editor of the volume says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Notwithstanding the rents, duties, and services, and the fine
paid on entering, the inferior tenants of the Prior had a beneficial
interest in their holdings, which gave rise to a recognized system of
tenant-right, which we may see growing into a customary right; the
only limitation of the tenant’s right being inability, from poverty or
other cause, to pay rent or perform the accustomed services.”</p>
</div>

<p>When the monastery of Durham was suppressed and its
place of the Cathedral Prior and Monks taken by a Dean
and Chapter, it was found, by the middle of Elizabeth’s reign,
that the change was gravely detrimental to the interests of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
the tenants, and the new body soon made it plain that they
had no intention of respecting prescriptive rights. This
appears clearly in a document printed in the same volume,
about which the editor says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A review of the Halmote Rolls leaves no room for doubt that
the tenants, other than those of the demesne lands, during the
period covered by the text, had a recognized tenant-right in their
holdings, which was ripening into a customary freehold estate; and
we might have expected to find, in the vills or townships in which
the Dean and Chapter possessed manorial rights, the natural outcome
of this tenant-right in the existence of copyhold or customary freehold
estates at the present time, as we find in the manors of the see
of Durham. It is a well-known fact, however, that there are none.
The reason is, that soon after the foundation of the Cathedral body,
the Dean and Chapter refused to recognize a customary estate in
their tenants.”</p>
</div>

<p>The presence of “minstrels” at parish dinners and feasts
has already been noticed. It is probable that these musicians
were more frequently employed to enliven “the deadly
dulness of village life” than might now be supposed. At
Tatton, from which many of these illustrations have been
taken, the payments for “minstrels” in the sixteenth century
come very regularly into the parish accounts; and it seems
hardly very far-fetched to suggest that these musicians
probably went from one parish feast-day to another, as at
the present day the brass band goes from one village
club-day celebration to another.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A word may be usefully said about the effect of religion
on the family life generally. Regularity of attendance at
all religious celebrations in the church was universal, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
practically so. This was the case, not on account of any
ecclesiastical compulsion—although, in case of need, it could
be, and no doubt was exerted—but, as far as it is possible to
judge, the church services were attended and religious duties
fulfilled, as part of the Christian life which all desired to
follow, and in deference to a healthy public opinion which,
in these matters, did not admit of backsliding.</p>

<p>The father’s and the mother’s duty of bringing up their
children to know God’s law and to keep it, was fully
understood.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Every man and woman,” says the author of <i>Dives and Pauper</i>,
“after his degree, is bound to do his business to know God’s law
that he is bound to keep. And fathers, mothers, godfathers and
godmothers be bound to teach their children God’s law or else do
them to be taught.</p>

<p>“St. Austin saith that each man in his own household should
do the office of bishop in teaching and correcting of common things,
and therefore saith the law that the office of teaching and chastising
belongeth not only to the bishop but to every governor after his
manner and his degree: to the poor man governing his poor household;
to the rich man governing his folk; to the husband governing
his wife; to the father and mother governing their children.”</p>
</div>

<p>Filial affection was strongly inculcated in the common
teachings. In a will of one John Sothil of Dewsbury, in
1500, is expressed the last wish of one who had evidently
been brought up to reverence his own parents. “Also I
pray, Thomas my son, in my name and for the love of God,
that he never strive with his moder, as he will have my
blessing, for he shall find her curtous to del with.”</p>

<p>Grace with meals—before and after—was not only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
law, but the practice. To ask God’s blessing over what His
bounty had provided, and to thank Him afterwards, was an
elementary duty of all living the Christian life. Children
were taught the importance of associating God and His
providence with their meals, and, as in so many other
matters, instruction was conveyed in some simple rhymes
like—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He that without grace sitteth down to eate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgetting to give God thanks for his meate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And riseth againe letting Grace overpasse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sittes down like an oxe and riseth like an asse.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Children were taught to rise early, as the <i>Babe of Nurture</i>
says—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ryse you early in the morning</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For it hath propertyes three</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Holynesse, health and happy welth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As my father taught mee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At syxe of the clocke, without delay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Use commonly to ryse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And give God thanks for thy good rest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When thou openest thy eyes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The young were taught also to pay respect to their elders,
and in particular to their parents. They were to be reverential
in their manner and to avoid giving them displeasure.
The parent, on his part, was to refrain from setting a bad
example, but was to see that, the first thing in the morning,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Or he do eny worldli deede,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>his son was to lift up his heart to God, and pray that God
may lead him through the day without sin. At the close of
the day, after prayers, the child was to be taught to fall
asleep thinking of heavenly things: with some such thought
as—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The inventories of parish churches and the churchwardens’
accounts show how very common a feature the
religious plays—“miracle or mystery plays,” as they were
generally called—were in the village life of the fifteenth
century. It requires very little examination of the “books”
of those plays that have come down to us to see that
these sacred dramas must have been most powerful aids
to the religious teaching of the Church among the simple
and unlettered villagers of England, and even among the
crowds which thronged great cities like Coventry, Chester,
and York to witness the traditional acting of the more
elaborate performances.</p>

<p>As to their popularity there can be no question. Dramatic
representations of the chief events in the life of our Lord,
etc., were intimately associated with the religious purposes
for which they were originally produced. They were played
on Sundays and feast-days, sometimes in the aisles of the
churches, in church porches and churchyards. The author
of <i>Dives and Pauper</i> says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Spectacles, plays, and dances that are used on great feasts,
as they are done principally for devotion and honest mirth, and
to teach men to love God the more, are lawful if the people be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
not thereby hindered from God’s service, nor from hearing God’s
word, and provided that in such spectacles and plays there is
mingled no error against the faith of Holy Church and good living.
All other plays are prohibited, both on holidays and work-days
(according to the law), upon which the gloss saith that the representation
in plays at Christmas of Herod and the Three Kings, and other
pieces of the Gospel, both then and at Easter and other times, is
lawful and commendable.”</p>
</div>

<p>There can be no reasonable doubt that such simple
dramatic representations of the chief mysteries of religion and
the principal events in our Lord’s life, or of some incidents
in the lives of the saints, served to impress these truths
and fix these events upon the imaginations of the audiences
that witnessed them, and to make them in the true sense
of the words “vivid realities.” The religious drama was
the handmaiden of the Church, and it helped to instruct
the people at large and, quite as much as the painted wall
or pictured window, formed a “book” ever open and easily
understood, graphically setting forth and illustrating truths
which formed the groundwork of the formal instruction in
the Sunday sermon.</p>

<p>Whatever we may in these days be inclined to think
of these simple stories as literary works, or however we
may be inclined now to smile at some of the “stage
situations” and odd characters, there can be no doubt what
the people for whom they were written and acted thought.
“In great devotion and discretion,” says the chronicler,
“Higden published the story of the Bible, that the simple
people might understand in their own language.”</p>

<p>The subjects treated of in these plays were very varied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
although those that were acted on the great festivals of
Christmas, Easter, the Ascension, etc., generally had some
relation to the mystery then celebrated. In such a collection
of plays as that known as the <i>Towneley Mysteries</i>, we have
examples of the subjects treated of in the religious plays
of the period. The collection makes no pretence of being
complete, and yet it contains some three and thirty plays,
including the Creation, the death of Abel, the story of Noah,
the sacrifice of Isaac, and other Old Testament histories;
a great number of scenes from the New Testament, such
as the Annunciation, the Visitation, Cæsar Augustus, scenes
from the Nativity, the Shepherds, the Magi, etc., as well
as various scenes from the Passion and Crucifixion, the
Parable of the Talents, etc.</p>

<p>Any one who will take the trouble to read—not skim—the
plays as printed in this volume cannot fail to be
impressed not only with the vivid picture of the special
scenes, but by the extensive knowledge of the Bible which
the production of these plays must have imparted to those
who listened to them, and by the way that, incidentally,
the most important religious truths are conveyed in the
crude and rugged verse. Again and again, for instance,
the entire dependence of all created things upon the
providence of God Almighty is asserted and illustrated.
Thus, the confession of God’s Omnipotence, put into the
mouth of Noah at the beginning of the play of “Noah
and his Sons,” contains a profession of belief in the Holy
Trinity, and a declaration concerning the work of the
Three Persons in the world. It describes the creation of the
world; the fall of Lucifer; the sin of our first parents, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
their expulsion from Paradise. In the story of Abraham,
too, the prayer of the patriarch, with which it begins—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Adonai, thou God very,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou hear us when to Thee we call,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As Thou are He that bset may,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou art most succour and help of all,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>gives a complete <i>résumé</i> of the Bible history before the
days of Abraham, with the purpose of showing that all
things are in God’s hands, and that the complete obedience
of all creatures whom He has made is due to Him.</p>

<p>Whatever we may think of these religious dramas now,
there can be no doubt that the people in the pre-Reformation
days delighted in them, and that they formed one of the
most popular features in mediæval parochial life.</p>

<p class="ph3">GUILDS AND FRATERNITIES</p>


<p>Every account of a mediæval parish must necessarily
include some description of the work of fraternities
and guilds. Although these societies, absolutely speaking,
were not existent in every parish, still they were so
very general that they may be reckoned certainly as one
feature of pre-Reformation parochial life. It is hardly
necessary to say much upon the subject of guild origins.
Their existence dates from the earliest times, and they
probably were one result of the natural desire to realize
some of the obvious benefits arising from combination, in
carrying out purposes of common utility. As a system
of widespread practical institutions, “English guilds,” says
Mr. Toulmin Smith, who may be regarded as our great
authority on this matter, “are older than any kings of
England.” The oldest of our ancient laws—those, for
example, of Alfred, of Athelstan and Ina—assume the
existence of guilds, to some one of which, as a matter of
course, every one was supposed to belong. The same
author thus defines the scope and purpose of the ancient
guilds. “They were,” he says, “associations of those living
in the same neighbourhood, who remembered that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
had, as neighbours, common obligations.” They were
different entirely from modern partnerships or trading
companies, for their main characteristic was to set up
something higher than personal gain and mere materialism
as the main object of man’s existence, and to make the teaching
of love to one’s neighbour, not merely accepted as a hollow
dogma of morality, but known and felt as a habit of life.</p>

<p>An examination of the existing records leads to a general
division of mediæval guilds into two classes—<i>Craft</i> or <i>Trade</i>
Associations and <i>Religious</i> Societies; or, as some prefer now
to call them, <i>Social</i> Guilds. It is with these latter that we
are here chiefly concerned. The former, as their name implies,
had as the special object of their existence the protection
of some kind of work, trade, or handicraft; and in this,
for practical purposes, we may include those associations of
traders or merchants known under the name of “Guild-Merchants.”
Such, for instance, were the great Companies
of the City of London; and it was in reality the plea that
they were trading societies, which saved them from the
general destruction which overtook all fraternities and
associations in the sixteenth century. The division of
guilds into the two classes named above is, however, after
all, a matter of convenience, rather than a real distinction,
grounded on fact. All guilds, no matter for what special
purpose they were founded, had the same general characteristic
principle of brotherly love and social charity; and no
guild, so far as I have been able to discover, was divorced
from the ordinary religious observances commonly practised
in those days.</p>

<p>In speaking, therefore, of the purposes of what I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
called religious or social guilds, I must not be thought to
exclude craft or trade guilds. It is very often supposed
that, for the most part, what are called religious guilds
existed for the purpose of promoting or encouraging some
religious practice, such as attendance at church on certain
days; taking part in ecclesiastical processions; the recitation
of offices and prayers, and the like. Without doubt there
were such societies existing in pre-Reformation days, such
as, for example, was the great Guild of Corpus Christi, in
York, which counted its members by thousands. But such
associations were the exception, not the rule. It is really
astonishing to find how small a proportion these <i>ecclesiastical</i>
or purely religious guilds formed of the whole number of
associations known as guilds. The origin of the mistaken
notion is obvious.</p>

<p>In mediæval days—that is, in the days when such
guilds flourished—the word “religious” had a wider, and
in many ways a truer signification than has obtained
in later times. Religion was understood to include the
exercise of the two commandments of charity—the love
of God, and the love of one’s neighbour; and the exercises
of practical charity, to which guild brethren were bound
by their guild statutes, were considered as much religious
practices as the attendance at church, or the taking part
in any ecclesiastical procession. In these days, as Mr.
Brentano, in his essay <i>On the History and Development of
Gilds</i>, has pointed out, most of the objects, to carry out
which the guilds existed, would be called <i>Social</i> duties;
but then, in mediæval times, they were regarded as objects
of Christian charity. “Mutual assistance, the aid of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
poor, of the helpless, the sick, of strangers, pilgrims, and
prisoners, the burial of the dead, even the keeping of schools
and schoolmasters,” and other such-like objects of Christian
charity, were held to be “exercises of religion.”</p>

<p>By whichever name we prefer to call them, the character
and purpose of these mediæval guilds cannot in reality be
misunderstood. Broadly speaking, they were the benefit
societies and the provident associations of the Middle Ages.
They undertook towards their members the duties now
frequently performed by burial clubs, by hospitals, by almshouses,
and by guardians of the poor. Not infrequently they
are found acting for the public good of the community in
the mending of roads and in the repair of bridges. They
looked to the private good of their members in the same
way that insurance companies to-day compensate for loss
by fire or accident. The very reason of their existence
was to afford mutual aid, and by timely contributions to
meet the pecuniary demands which were constantly arising
from burials, legal exactions, penal fines, and all other kinds
of payments and compensations. Mr. Toulmin Smith thus
defines their object: “The early English guild was an
institution of local self-help, which, before the poor-laws
were invented, took the place, in old times, of the modern
Friendly or Benefit Society, but with a higher aim; while
it joined all classes together in the care of the needy and
for objects of common welfare, it did not neglect the forms
and practice of religion, justice, and morality,” which, it may
be added, was indeed the mainspring of their life and action.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Guild lands,” writes Mr. Thorold Rogers, “were a very
important economical fact in the social condition of early England.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
The Guilds were the benefit societies of the time, from which impoverished
members could be and were aided. It was an age in
which the keeping of accounts was common and familiar. Beyond
question, the treasurers of the village Guild rendered as accurate
an annual statement to the members of their fraternity as a bailiff
did to his lord.... It is quite certain that the town and country
guilds obviated pauperism in the middle ages, assisted in steadying
the price of labour, and formed a permanent centre for those associations
which fulfilled the function that in more recent times trade
unions have striven to satisfy.”</p>
</div>

<p>An examination of the various articles of association
contained in the returns made into the Chancery in 1389,
and other similar documents, shows how wide was the field
of Christian charity covered by these “fraternities.” First
and foremost among such works of religion must be reckoned
the burial of the dead, regulations as to which are invariably
to be found in all the guild statutes. Then came, very
generally, provisions for help to the poor, sick, and aged.
In some, assistance was to be given to those who were overtaken
by misfortune, whose goods had been damaged or
destroyed by fire or flood, or had been diminished by loss
or robbery; in others, money was found as a loan to such
as needed temporary assistance. In the guild at Ludlow,
in Shropshire, for instance, “any good girl of the guild had
a dowry provided for her if her father was too poor to find
one himself.” The “guild-merchant” of Coventry kept a
lodging-house with thirteen beds, “to lodge poor folk coming
through the land on pilgrimage or other work of charity ...
with a keeper of the house and a woman to wash the pilgrims’
feet.” A guild at York found beds and attendance
for poor strangers, and the Guild of Holy Cross in Birmingham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
kept almshouses for the poor in the town. In Hampshire,
the guild of St. John at Winchester, which comprised men
and women of all sorts and conditions, supported a hospital
for the needy and infirm of the city.</p>

<p>Speaking of the poor, Bishop Hobhouse, in his preface
to the Somerset churchwardens’ accounts, says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I can only suppose that the brotherhood tie was so strongly
realized by the community (of the parish) that the weaker were
succoured by the stronger, as out of a family store. The brotherhood
tie was, no doubt, very much stronger then, when the village
community was from generation to generation so unalloyed by anything
foreign, when all were knit together by one faith and one
worship and close kindred, but, further than this, the Guild-fellowship
must have enhanced all the other bonds in drawing men to spare their
worldly goods as a common stock. Covertly, if not overtly, the
guildsman bound himself to help his needy brother in sickness and
age, as he expected his fellow-guildsman to do for him in his turn
of need; and these bonds, added to a far stronger sense of the duty
of children towards aged parents than is now found, did, I conceive,
suffice for the relief of the poor, aided only by the direct almsgiving
which flowed from the parsonage house, or in favoured localities,
from the doles or broken meat of a monastery.”</p>
</div>

<p>For the purpose of collecting money for parochial needs,
the services of the various fraternities were constantly requisitioned.
In some places, as at St. Dunstan’s, Canterbury, the
authorized collectors wore badges, by which they could be
recognized as such; at others, as at St. Peter’s Cheap, London,
the various brotherhoods were connected with some special
chapel, or altar, or statue, and regularly collected for the
particular end of their society. In some parishes these religious
fraternities were more numerous than many at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
day would be inclined to suppose. At St. Dunstan’s, Canterbury,
just mentioned, there was first the brotherhood of the
“Schaft,” which seems to have been a general society embracing
the whole parish, and which possessed property, such
as malt, barley, wheat, cattle, and sheep. Besides this, there
was the fraternity of St. Anne, which included women, and that
of St. John; there were also small groups under their wardens;
and of these we have the wardens of St. John’s light, those
of St. Anne’s light, and those of St. Katherine. Mr. Cowper,
the editor of these accounts, on this remarks: “These all go
to show what life and activity there was in the little parish,
which never wanted willing men to devote their time and
influence to the management of their own affairs.”</p>

<p>In times of common need, or when some great work of
repair or of decoration was undertaken by the parish for
their church, the various “fraternities” are found contributing
out of their peculiar “stores” to the object. At Ashburton,
for example, in 1486-87, a “silver foot” was made to the
parish cross, and also the weather-cock got out of order and
had to be seen to. To both of these objects there were
contributions from “the stores of St. Nicholas,” and “of
St. George,” etc. In fact, in this parish there were apparently
about a dozen of these confraternities, namely: “the Stores
of the B. V. Mary;” of “the Junior torches;” of St. George,
St. Margaret, St. Clement; of “the Wyvyn store” of B. V.
Mary; of St. Thomas of Canterbury; of St. James and of
St. Giles. Some of these had as much as forty shillings at
one time as a fund under their administration.</p>

<p>Some of the “fraternities” were merely spiritual associations,
which helped to strengthen the bond of brotherhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
between parishes. One such existed in connection with the
Cathedral of Lichfield, called the “Fraternity of the Brethren
and Sisters of St. Chad.” Enrolled as members are many
bishops, abbots, priors, and other religious superiors, besides
priests and all sorts and conditions of lay people. The priests
were all pledged to say Masses for the welfare of the associates,
living or dead. Thus, in each of the abbeys of Darley,
Burton, and Shrewsbury, 100 Masses were said yearly for this
end; at Trentham Priory 60 Masses; and at the Convent of
Derby 300 psalters by the Benedictine Nuns were said for
the associates. In the Cathedral church of Lichfield also four
Masses were said daily, two for the living and two for the
dead members; and in every associated parish 30 Masses
were said during the year. In all these churches, every
Sunday before the Holy Water, the “Our Father” was said
by priest and people, “with hands raised,” followed by a
versicle and prayer to St. Chad. In the fifteenth century,
when the bishop gave an indulgence to all those who were
members of the fraternity, he states that this union of prayer
already comprised 2434 Masses and 452 psalters yearly.</p>

<p>The organization of these societies was the same as that
which has existed in similar associations up to the time of our
modern trade unions. A meeting was held, at which officers
were elected and accounts audited; fines for non-acceptance
of office were frequently imposed, as well as for absence from
the common meeting. Often members had to declare, on
oath, that they would fulfil their voluntary obligations, and
would keep secret the affairs of the society. Persons of
ill repute were not admitted, and members who disgraced
the fraternity were expelled. For example, the first guild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
statutes printed by Mr. Toulmin Smith are those of Garlekhith,
London. They begin—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In worship of God Almighty our Creator and His Mother,
Saint Mary, and all Saints and St. James the Apostle, a fraternity
is begun by good men in the Church of St. James at Garlekhith in
London, on the day of Saint James, the year of our Lord 1375, for
the amendment of their lives and of their souls, and to nourish
greater love between the brethren and sisters of the said brotherhood.”</p>
</div>

<p>Each of them have sworn on the Book to perform the
points underwritten—</p>

<p>“First, all those that are, or shall be, in the said brotherhood
shall be of good life, condition, and behaviour, and
shall love God and Holy Church and their neighbours, as
Holy Church commands.” Then, after various provisions as
to meetings and payments to be made to the general fund,
the statutes order that “if any of the aforesaid brethren fall
into such distress that he hath nothing and cannot, on account
of old age or sickness, help himself, if he has been in the
brotherhood seven years, and during that time has performed
all the duties, he shall have every week after from the common
box fourteen pence (<i>i.e.</i> about &#163;1 of our money) for the rest
of his life, unless he recovers from his distress.” In one form
or other this provision for the assistance of needy members
is repeated in the statutes of almost every guild. Some
provide for help in case of distress coming “through any
chance, through fire or water, thieves or sickness, or any
other haps.” Some, besides this kind of aid, add, “and if it
so befall that he be young enough to work, and he fall into
distress, so that he have nothing of his own to help himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
with, then the brethren shall help him, each with a portion
as he pleases in the way of charity.” Others furnish loans
from the common fund to enable brethren to tide over temporary
difficulties. “And if the case falleth that any of the
brotherhood have need to borrow a certain sum of silver,
he (can) go to the keepers of the box and take what he
hath need of, so that the sum be not so large that one may
not be helped as another, and that he leave a sufficient
pledge, or else find a sufficient security among the brotherhood.”
Some, again, make the contributions to poor brethren
a personal obligation on the members, such as a farthing a
week from each of the brotherhood, unless the distress has
been caused by folly or waste. Others extend their Christian
charity to relieve distress beyond the circle of the brotherhood—that
is, of any “whosoever falls into distress, poverty,
lameness, blindness, sent by the grace of God to them, even
if he be a thief proven, he shall have sevenpence a week
from the brothers and sisters to assist him in his need.”
Some of the guilds in seaside districts provide for help in
case of “loss through the sea,” and there is little doubt that
in mediæval days the great work carried on by such a body
as the Royal Lifeboat Society would have been considered
a work of religion, and the fitting object of a religious guild.</p>

<p>Dr. Jessopp has described for us the functions of these
religious brotherhoods—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Besides all this there were small associations, called Gilds, the
members of which were bound to devote a certain portion of their time
and money and their energies to keep up the special commemoration
and the special worship of some Saint’s chapel or shrine, which was
sometimes kept up in a corner of the church, and provided with an
altar of its own, and served by a chaplain who was actually paid by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
the subscriptions or free-will offerings of the members of the gild
whose servant he was. Frequently there were half a dozen of these
brotherhoods, who met on different days in the year; and frequently—indeed,
one may say usually—there was a church house, a kind of
parish club, in which the gilds held their meetings and transacted
their business.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the account of the “Building of Bodmin Church” in
the fifteenth century we have an example of the working of
this guild system. Every one appears to have given according
to his means, and even generously. There were personal
gifts, like that of an “hold woman,” who gave 3<i>s.</i> 2½<i>d.</i>; and
another woman, in addition to her subscription, sold her
“crokk for 20<i>d.</i>” and gave the money to the Church. But
the success of the enterprise evidently is to be attributed to
the guilds which existed at that time in great numbers and
in a most flourishing state in Bodmin. “Religious life,” we
are told, “permeated society, particularly in the fifteenth
century.” In Bodmin at that time almost every inhabitant
seems to have been included in one or other of the many
fraternities. Indeed, the spirit of association seems to have
been so strong at this time that various groups of people
joined themselves together for the purpose of making a
common gift. In this way we read that “the young maidens
of Fore Street and Bore Street” gave a common subscription
in addition to the sums received from the Guild of Virgins in
the same streets.</p>

<p>These interesting accounts also give the names of no
fewer than forty guilds, all more or less connected with the
parish church of Bodmin. Of these, five are trade guilds: the
skinners and glovers under the patronage of St. Petroc; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
smiths under St. Dunstan and St. Eloy; the cordwainers
under St. Anian; the millers under St. Martin; and the
tailors and drapers under St. John the Baptist. All the
rest of these fraternities “were,” says the editor of these
accounts, “established for social and religious objects, for
the glory of God and the good of man.” For the “wax
gathering,” money was received from (1) the Guild of St.
David in “forestreet;” (2) St. Luke; (3) St. Michael; (4)
Holy Trinity; (5) St. Leodgarius; (6) St. Clare; (7) St.
Gregory, Pope; (8) St. Thomas; (9) B. V. Mary in the porch
of the church; (10) Holy Trinity; (11) St. Katherine; (12)
St. Anian; (13) St. Stephen; (14) St. Mary Magdalene;
(15) St. James; (16) Holy Cross; (17) B. V. Mary in the
chancel; (18) B. V. Mary in the chapel of St. Gregory;
(19) St. Loy; (20) St. Petroc; (21) St. John; (22) St.
Thomas “in Church hay;” (23) Corpus Christi.</p>

<p>One purpose of distinct utility to the parish, which was
served by the guilds, was the provision of additional priests
for the services of the church. In this they had the same
object as the founders of chantries had in establishing them.
Thus, to take an example, in the “Chantry Certificates”
for Suffolk the purpose of the Guild of the Holy Ghost at
Beccles is stated to have been to keep a priest “to celebrate
in the church,” to “pay the tithes, fifteenths and other taxes,”
and to contribute 40<i>s.</i> a year to the poor. A note appended
says that “Beccles is a great and populous town” of “800
houseling” people, and “the said priest is aiding unto the
curate there, who without help is not able to discharge the
said cure. The said Guild is erected of devotion.” So, too,
to take another example, in the parish of Bingham, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
Nottinghamshire, there was “a guild of our Lady to maintain
a priest;” and the Palmer’s Guild of Ludlow, sometimes
called the “Fraternity of St John,” which was maintained
partly by endowments of land and partly through the
donations of its members, maintained no fewer than ten
priests out of its funds.</p>

<p>In reality there is hardly any good and useful purpose
which can be imagined, religious or social, to which some
mediæval guild or other was not devoted. Mr. Toulmin
Smith, after examination of the documents relating to these
fraternities, has enumerated the following as objects for
which they were founded, or at any rate worked: (1) relief
in poverty—a very general object; (2) sickness; (3) old age;
(4) loss of sight; (5) loss of limb; (6) loss of cattle; (7) on
fall of house; (8) in making pilgrimages; (9) loss by fire;
(10) loss by flood; (11) loss by robbery; (12) shipwreck;
(13) imprisonment; (14) aid in pecuniary difficulties; (15)
aid to obtain work; (16) defending in law; (17) relief to
deaf and dumb; (18) relief for leprosy; (19) dowry on
marriage or on entry into religious house; (20) repairs of
roads and bridges; (21) repairs of churches; (22) burial of
the dead.</p>

<p>Mr. Thorold Rogers, in his <i>Economic Interpretation of
History</i>, says of the Guilds that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“they were well-nigh universal, though they were unchartered and
informal. Their prosperity was derived from grants or charges on
land or houses made for the purpose of securing the continuance
of a religious office, much appreciated and exceeding common in the
period of English social history which precedes the Reformation,
prayers or Masses for the dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>“The ancient tenements, which are still the property of the
London companies, were originally burdened with Masses for
donors. In the country the parochial clergy undertook the services
of these chantries.... The establishment of a Mass or chantry
priest at a fixed stipend, in a church with which he had no other
relation, was a common form of endowment. The residue, if any,
of the revenue derivable from these tenements was made the common
property of the Guild, and as the continuity of the service was the
great object of its establishment, the donor, like the modern trustee
of a life income, took care that there should be a surplus from the
foundation. The land or house was let, and the Guild consented to
find the ministration which formed the motive of the grant.”</p>
</div>

<p>This is very true, but it may be questioned whether Mr.
Thorold Rogers appreciated the extent to which these
chantry funds were intended to be devoted to purposes other
than the performance of the specified religious services.
Certainly writers generally have treated the question of the
chantries as if they had no object but the keeping of obits
or anniversary services for the original founder and his kin.
To show what really was the case, it may be well to take
a couple of instances in Hampshire. In connection with the
parish church of Alton in the sixteenth century there were
six obits or chantries. The following is the account of these
which I take from the Chantry Certificates made by the
King’s Commissioners in the first year of the reign of
Edward VI.:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“(1) Issues of land for an obit for John Pigott; growing and
coming out of certain houses and lands in Alton, for to maintain
for ever a yearly obit there, in the tenure of Thomas Mathew of
the yearly value of 23<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> Whereof to the poor 15<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, to the
priest and his clerk 8<i>s.</i>: (2) The same for an obit for William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
Reding of the annual value of 15<i>s.</i>, of which the poor were to have
10<i>s.</i> and the priest and his clerk 5<i>s.</i>: (3) The same for Alice Hacker
of the yearly value of 10<i>s.</i>, of which the poor were to get 7<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and
the priest 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>: (4) Another of the value of 4<i>s.</i>, the poor getting
2<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> and the priest 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>: (5) Another for the soul of Nicholas
Bailey, worth annually 11<i>s.</i>, and of this 7<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> was intended for the
poor and 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for the clergy: (6) Another for Nicholas Crushelow
worth 4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, the poor getting 3<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> and the priest 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>That is to say, out of a total of 77<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> the poor were to
get 46<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, and only 31<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> was devoted to the ecclesiastical
services connected with the obits of Alton. Or, if we take the
value of money in those days as being only twelve times
that of our present money, out of a total of &#163;36 12<i>s.</i> some
&#163;27 19<i>s.</i> went to support the poor.</p>

<p>As a further example of the way in which property was
left to a guild as trustees, the case of the “Candlemas
Guild” at Bury St. Edmund’s may be cited. A few years
after its foundation in 1471, one of its members left the
guild considerable property for the common purposes of the
fraternity, and for certain other specified objects. The name
of the donor was John Smith, and his will was witnessed by
the Abbot and Prior of Bury. It provided for the keep of an
annual obit “devoutly,” and for the residue of income to be
kept till the appointment of every new abbot. On that event
the sum thus accumulated was to be paid to the new abbot in
lieu of the sum of money the town was bound to find at every
election. Should there be any sum over the amount necessary
for this purpose, it was to be expended in payment of
the tenth or fifteenth, or other tax imposed on the citizens by
royal authority. Year by year, at the annual meeting of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
guild, the wardens were bound to give an account of their
administration of this trust. Year by year John Smith’s will
was read out at the meeting, and proclamation was made
before the anniversary of his death in the following manner:
“Let us all of charity pray for the soul of John. We put you
in remembrance that you shall not miss the keeping of his
dirge and also of his Mass.” Round the town went the crier
also with the lines—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We put you in remembrance all that the oath have made,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To come to the Mass and the dirge the souls for to glade;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All the inhabitants of this towne are bound to do the same,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To pray for the souls of John and Anne, else they be to blame;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The which John afore-rehearsed to this town hath been full kind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Three hundred marks for this town hath paid, no penny unpaid behind.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now we have informed you of John Smith’s will in writing as it is,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And for the great gifts that he hath given, God bring his soul to bliss.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Amen.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The example set by this donor to the Candlemas Guild
at Bury was followed by many others in the latter part of the
fifteenth century. For instance, “a gentlewoman,” as she
calls herself, Margaret Odom, after providing by will for the
usual obit, and for a lamp to burn before “the holie sacrament
in St. James’ church,” desires that the brethren of the guild
shall devote the residue of the income arising from certain
houses and lands she has conveyed to their keeping, to
paying a priest to “say mass in the chapel of the gaol before
the prisoners there, and giving them holy water and holy
bread on all Sundays, and to give to the prisoners of the long
ward of the said gaol every week seven faggots of wood from
Hallowmas (November 1) to Easter day.”</p>

<p>One function of the mediæval guilds must not be altogether
passed by. This was their attendance at the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
processions, and notably at that of Corpus Christi. Some
guilds, like the celebrated Corpus Christi Guild at York,
with its thousands of members, were, of course, founded
chiefly to do honour to the Blessed Sacrament. But, ordinarily,
guilds of every kind were only too ready in those
days to take part in the ecclesiastical pageants of the day.
One example will suffice. It is the Order of the Corpus
Christi procession at Winchester in 1435—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At a convocation held at the city of Winchester the Friday
next before the feast of Corpus Christi, in the 13th yere of the raigne
of King Harry the sixt, after the Conquest—it was ordained by
Richard Salter, mayor of the cytie of Winchester, John Symer and
Harry Putt, Bailiffs of the cytie aforesaid, and also by all the cytizens
and commonaltee of the same cytie: It is accorded of a certain
general processyon in the feste of Corpus Christi of diverse artyficers
and crafts within the same cytie being: that is to say: the Carpenters
and Felters shall go together first; Smythes and Barbers,
second; Cooks and Buchers, third; Shomakers with two lights,
fourth; Tanners and Tapaners, fifth; Plummers and Silkmen, sixth;
Fyshers and Farryers, seventh; Taveners, eighth; Wevyres with two
lights, ninth; Fullars, with two lights, tenth; Dyers with two lights,
eleventh; Chandlers and Brewers, twelfth; Mercers with two lights,
thirteenth; Wyves with one light and John Blak with another, fourteenth;
and all these lights shall be borne orderlie before the said
procession before the prieste of the citie. And four lyghtes of the
Brethren of St. John’s shall be borne about the Body of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the same day in the procession aforesaid.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lastly, it may be well to give an instance of some of the
laws under which the mediæval guild system was governed.
For this purpose the Statutes of the “Guild of the Purification
of our Lady” at Bury St. Edmund’s, which were revised
and renewed in 1471, may be taken as a sample:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>1. All members were to swear obedience to the laws:
were to pay 4<i>d.</i> on enrollment and 1<i>d.</i> to the light kept by
the guild in the parish church: they must also get a surety
to pay 10<i>s.</i> to the property of the fraternity on their death.</p>

<p>2. On becoming members all shall swear to fulfil the wills
of John Smith and Margaret Odham, which were written in
English at the beginning of the book, and which were to be
read every year at the Guild dinner on February 2. After
the dinner all members of the Guild shall kneel and say the
<i>De profundis</i> and the “prayers that long therto” for the souls
of the above founders.</p>

<p>3. All officers to be elected yearly.</p>

<p>4. All shall “have every year ther presens and speche
daye at the charnell or in the churchyard in the day of the
Epiphany for the ordynaunce and profit of the guylde. And
yf any be absent of the sayde fraternytie but if he have a
reasonable excuse he shall loose a pounde waxe.”</p>

<p>5. All shall come to the Guild hall “anent after evensonge
the daye of the Purification to the beadesbydding and
there devoutly to praye for all the brethrene and systerne
sowles that have been in guylde aforesaide.” For absence a
fine of a pound of wax.</p>

<p>In the foregoing chapters I have endeavoured to gather
together from the scattered and frequently minute material
which exists some illustrations of parochial life in mediæval
times. The result must speak for itself; it is, I feel sure, as
far as it goes, correct as to the outline of the picture. Had
I not been anxious not to weary the reader by the very
multiplicity and minuteness of the details, the result might
have been perhaps more definite, and the lights and shades
been more effective. As it is, however, my purpose has been
accomplished if I have succeeded in interesting them
in this description of the life led by our ancestors in a
mediæval parish—a life so strangely and entirely different
to that which now exists in the towns and villages of modern
England. For “in the Middle Ages,” says a writer in a
late number of <i>The National Review</i>, in a passage already
referred to, “the conscious sharing in a world-wide tradition
bound the local to the universal life, and through art and
ritual the minds of the poor were familiarized with facts of
the Christian faith. By our own poor I fear these facts are
very dimly realized.”</p>
